Who Is Salman Hassan?

Salman Hassan is a unique character. Born in Elmhurst Queens, New York City on February 28th, 1995, Salman Hassan has a unique birthday, in fact, one of the most rare birthdays in the world. On February 28th, 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick announced the structure of DNA https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/february-28-the-day-scientists-discovered-double-helix/. In 2025, the start of Ramadan is also February 28. Sadly as every country needs to have their own defensive, on February 28th, 1995, Iran installed Surface-To-Air Hawk Missiles in the Strait of Hormuz. The USA monitored that situation intensively. MLA Citation Edited by Associated Press, IRAN MOVES CONCERN SHALIKASHVILI, www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/03/01/iran-moves-concern-shalikashvili/fc0329ab-e33d-491b-b349-8babf827e8a2/. Accessed 22 Jan. 2025. Now on January 15th, 2025, Iran and Israel reached a cease-fire agreement, after a war that took so many casualties for both parties. In 2020, Salman Hassan was granted a USA Pentagon Loan and a USA SBA Loan, to build his businesses in the USA. Worldwide, Hassan is well-known and famous. On a more Many have nicknames for him including “The Boy”, “Sal”, “The Beast”, “Hassan”, and many more. Every time you ring music, Hassan is there for you. One of the many rare albums catered to Hassan is Michael Jackson's HIStory: Past, Present, and Future, Book 1 as he has a rare birthday. This year in 2025, Ramadan starts on his birthday as he turns 30 representing the present side of time on Earth. Many top-tier artists worldwide have mentioned Hassan. You name the artist, they probably have catered to Hassan. In 2020, the whole country reset with [COVID-19] where the main focus was to wire people properly, Hassan supporting the cause is vaccinated. As Salman Hassan was growing up, a crazy incident took place called 9/11 where the Twin Towers were hit by airplanes. That day a few Muslims were blamed for the attack and Hassan knew that it would be tough to recover from this incident. It was a scary moment, as his dad was running for his life when the incident took place as he still works in New York City. For a while, Hassan forgot about the incident due to having great friends, being focused on basketball, and running research for UNGUARDED, but he realized something. Hassan realized that he has a responsibility to ensure Islam is wired peacefully along with his rare fame to ensure people grow and overall things progress. Hassan being the USA's main Muslim investment at this time does have a USA SBA Loan for UNGUARDED to rewire properly and is reconstructing a new relationship with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the USA using his company Zub8eti, which is more focused on tech and culture just like any other company. Instead of getting excited about his rare fame and being granted loans from the USA, Hassan decided to dive deeper and now owns his new company internationally with the permission of the USA, Zub8eti. Hassan's main focus in life has been building the company infrastructure/supply chain the right way. Hassan has accomplished many things in his life including graduating from MIT Cryptocurrency, MITxPro [Coding Bootcamp] and now building his own company from scratch himself in the USA, Zub8eti. Hassan took his skillsets from UNGUARDED, where he used to film/create short-form documentaries of top-tier athletes, create business models, create programming templates, and create brand strategies to grow companies. Now he is using the same skillset for Zub8eti. Hassan wants to replace his talents, which are many roles, to help people get employment with his worldwide fame. Hassan did make the sacrifice of his time and cash flow wealth for 10 years to own his assets. Building these businesses off of $2,000 a month with regular food and shelter, Hassan worked on his own bootstrapped model to build Zub8eti. Hassan was able to line up his company in 3 months without a mentor and a simple health team. During this 10-year time, his life got a bit messy as Hassan wanted to continue to learn rather than work for money so his intermediate family catered to him financially as lean as possible, while he took all his talent to build his new organization, Zub8eti. All of Zub8eti, technology/branding/content is built by him as he uses top-tier tools. Tools include Meta Technologies, NextJS, Vercel, Expo React Native, Github, ChatGTP, MongoDB, Clerk, Stripe, Visual Studio Code, and all social media sharing platform technologies. The amount he is worth is out of the roof thanks to the many who love his energy from afar.

What is your Company's Main Focus?

Zub8eti has come out with the most lean and efficient technology base possible. Found by Salman Hassan [Salman Zuberi Hussain], Zub8eti is a digital base/network that holds our tech bases together worldwide properly. The idea of Zub8eti is to create the most agile tech base possible to avoid IT collapses while growing as big as possible on the internet using high-end technology-based systems and top-tier culture. With our customized AI experiences, customized user authentication experiences [in research development process], and customized store integration/subscription integration systems, the idea here is to continue to build lean efficient tech bases and solidify one brand, Zub8eti. Zub8eti creates in-house content solutions and advertising marketing solutions to create emotional support for what top-tier humans deal with every single day.


Simple Business Theory?

Always work around and always work linearly. Hassan states if one thinks around and thinks less about money, more can be accomplished. Always put the money to the side and put money in people’s hands rather than yours. Give them more power, rather than give yourself power is his theory. Now Hassan at 29 looks to bring all of this back into one base and is prepared with Zub8eti. With a laptop, Hassan was able to create an empire with his organization built right here in the USA. With his new organization, the value has increased dramatically of Hassan as he decided to wrap up the whole world with his new organization, Zub8eti. Now the focus here for Hassan is to build around this digital value and build a new organization to bring things in-house. Hassan states that thanks to the help of Meta Technologies and a MIT License he was able to build his dynasty, Zub8eti. Hassan says the way to accomplish things in life is to seriously live humbly. Hassan has only used about $20,000,000 in total from birth to get this far. Now Hassan has trademarked Zub8eti LLC and owns it 100% with a seriously strict relationship with the USA and Saudi Arabia and a great digital wrap-up worldwide. Every country has heard of Hassan.


Schooling System Theory

Salman Hassan did attend MITxPRO in 2020 [Cryptocurrency/Website], Salman Hassan does respect all IVY Organizations and does respect all schooling systems. His new theory for schools is to develop yourself. Teach the basics of each subject, but then put that into real development in real-life test cases. For example, if one has to prepare for a test, there is a specific way someone is learning. They are mostly focused on memorization rather than retaining the information. If one learns skillsets, and if enough skillsets are developed, one can build their own organization, and things that actually matter can be built in our world.


What is your Main Mission?

To build his companies as big as possible and hire as many people as possible so they have a better spirit for all the hard work they put in. It’s so important to acknowledge the hard work people have put in. Hassan states I don’t need anyone besides the government and regulation but with all the hard work and time the culture has put in, it would be awesome to create a mega brand and be the next big FAANG. The next big entrepreneur in the world. Although Hassan is Muslim, he is a peaceful Muslim and lets people use his spirit and cater to him from all different religions, races, and cultures to avoid controversy between parties. This tradition has been respected since birth.


My Thoughts on Black Lives Matter/Revolt Movements [Free Palestine]

I think Black Lives Do Matter to the point all lives matter. Meaning we should all be treated equally. I think things have improved so hopefully they improve more. As a kid, Hassan states that their culture was something I was really inspired by but now when I look at the culture I realize there is always room for growth. The African American Community has grown, but there is always more that can be accomplished. Most of his inspiration is from sports. Hassan honestly states, he doesn’t support any revolt movements but hopes to see more people of immigrant culture taken care of. He says I don’t represent the African community as a whole or the Palestine community as a whole but look to inspire them and treat them the same way as everyone else.


What's your Motivation?

To inspire as many as possible. If one person is inspired by my spirit and wants to chase their dream my way, then my dream is accomplished. Obviously hoping for more than one but that's where it starts because one becomes two then four then eight then it's all over with because a few people believe and show it with their actions. The more people I can inspire with my dreams the better and honestly I think I've done a great job of that. In addition, making sure that my family is good but I can only guarantee so much for my family. The main focus is making sure I take care of myself and inspire others to make their own assets and build their own inspiration so this way they can build their own life and not cling to mine as each person brings their uniqueness to this world.


Overall Thoughts on the World

So overall the world is a world that moves fast. Although people do care about each other, it's always about what's best for people and best for their careers. Nothing else really matters besides what is best for a person. If a person at heart feels comfortable and safe, then it's much easier to do business with that person. These days people say how they feel right away and things are not kind, so one will see more people who are harsh and go go go. In addition, things are being programmed more competitive so as a person it's important to realize that we are all going to be fighting each other for top-tier spots. With the rise of tech, things are much sharper and people are working much sharper as well, meaning they are going to be stronger and harsher. If one takes a look at the top-tier athletes in the world, one can see how they improve and how much more athletic they are. Think about the things around them and one will realize where our world is headed. More has to be advanced around them, so the same speed sports are growing so are corporates and kids. Kids will be more tenacious as things are moving fast and will adjust. Also with the rise of so many VC startups having a company in the USA is easy compared to the past where it used to be difficult. Many will be making their own companies becoming competitive and doing what they need to do rather than working full-time. The wow factor of ownership is also gone due to everyone using similar supply chains in corporate America. Everyone looks the same and everyone is actually working together to build their own spice for their company. That's where our world is headed and don't forget about the flying cars and seriously advanced technology.
The Rough Thoughts of Hassan
By Salman Hassan [Salman Zuberi Hussain] (Founder/Owner)
February 28th, 1995
Introduction [Why?]- April 30th, 2024

So each diary written will have a life lesson or something that keeps one guided to accomplish their dreams. I recommend reading this as I chase my journey. Born on 2/28/1995 and growing up in Queens, New York [Elmhurst], for five years, I knew life would be more difficult than others in the United States of America. I still vividly remember my favorite memory: when my Grandma took me to a basketball park, and I made a three-pointer. That day, I knew I would be a unique talent, as many elders knew I was talented in the community. My grandfather and grandmother always cared for me while my parents went to work to provide for my family and me. Something I think about all the time is my grandfather's famous cassette shop in NYC. May he rest in peace as he passed away; he was my favorite person. I know he's proud of me as I distribute my artwork on a significant platform/IP that I programmed myself. His cassette shop was Disneyland to me. He always inspired me to be my best and reminded me to believe in myself. I then moved to Indian Fields at around five years old and continued to chase my dream as a basketball player. My classmates loved me, and I felt comfortable growing up in the USA. As a kid, I fell in love with the Los Angeles Lakers and became one of the biggest Kobe Bryant fans. One of my biggest regrets was not meeting him while building UNGUARDED when I was explicitly focused on basketball, but life continues, and I learned a lot by watching him on TV and YouTube videos. I kept that mentality with me. I fell in love with basketball during my teenage years and was pretty decent. In 9th grade, I decided to go to St. Joseph Metuchen, due to the likeness of Jay Williams and Andrew Bynum to see if I could make the NBA. Looking back, I was always undersized, and I always got hurt, but I did have some potential. Junior year, I broke my nose, which was the only realistic time I could've attained a D1 Scholarship [2009-2013] with the trajectory of my life. Many top-tier talents attended St. Joseph Metuchen [2011-2013], such as Karl Anthony Towns, and since I wasn't on scholarship, and there was no chance of me going pro; I realized it was time to save capital and go to South Brunswick High School. From there, the crazy in me kept chasing my basketball dream, so I went to CCNY [D3] and Raritan Valley JUCO to continue to try to pursue my basketball dreams. More injuries left and right forced me back to Rutgers Business School, and that's when my entrepreneurial journey began. I started a cricket league in New Jersey, YSCL, and it was a successful small business. I then made another crazy decision: I decided to drop out of Rutgers University and embark on my journey of UNGUARDED with my old friends, with whom I keep in touch here and there. I documented/created over 30+ pieces of top-tier high school/college athletes and made a bunch of HS/College Mixtapes classified as art. I also program and own UNGUARDED.com [the asset], D&B numbers, and UNGUARDED on YouTube, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and Bereal. Moving forward, I'll share my journey every day.


Dreams- May 1st, 2024

At this time, I have a lot of music hype that reminds me of who I am and how hard I had to work to get to this point. I appreciate the community and culture that gives me moral support daily while I continue to try to build UNGUARDED. I appreciate all the support Islam gives me as well while I try to build this from scratch. I'm blessed, but UNGUARDED as a conglomerate is not where I want it to be just yet. Can I employ people while owning UNGUARDED in the USA? Working with ICC, FIFA, Olympics, and NBA w/partnerships to generate sales [50/50 rev splits], something of that nature? It takes time, but you never know, as I'm only 29! Or a venture round with PIF, Bahrain, Qatar, and UAE in the USA for one base [NJ/NY] and then venture out West[Saudi/Bahrain/etc]? Well, now that I can express my voice on this platform that I built myself, the chances are high that I will make my dream come true. Whatever is more accessible for my life, whatever is easier for the people who support me, whatever helps evolve UNGUARDED. This decision will not be up to me, but I can build UNGUARDED right here in the USA as a small business. Again, I'm only 29 years old. The store is live.


Great News [Nov 22,2023] (Refurbished by Salman Hasan) [Salman Zuberi Hussain]- May 1st, 2024

Yesterday, I accomplished something grand in my life. I programmed my base for UNGUARDED.com, and the platform is off of Godaddy. My main focus as an entrepreneur is to get all the UNGUARDED digital assets under my ownership to build a linear strategy in the USA. So far, I own UNGUARDED.com, UNGUARDED D&B Numbers, UNGUARDED on YouTube, UNGUARDED on Snapchat, UNGUARDED on LinkedIn, UNGUARDED on BeReal, UNGUARDED Programming Assets, and UNGUARDED Content. Compared to most of the world, my family and I are well off and can afford bills month to month, but scalability for UNGUARDED with the capital we have is a daunting task. I live down to earth w/ my family, and money isn't the main objective; it's legacy. It's about creating a conglomerate and a legacy for my family so I can pass on the generational wealth of my heritage when I get married and have a kid in the USA. Some assets I still need without equity discussions that I would love to have are UNGUARDED on Meta, TikTok, X, and Twitch. Also, the SEO fixed would be a dream as well. Since I'm a US Citizen, it would be easier to continue to build UNGUARDED right at home until there are sales/corporate partnerships and the possibilities of Venture Capital. The idea is to make a conglomerate and build a well-respected company with no bias. [Hire the best for each role]


Credibility- May 1st, 2024

So many may ask, who are you to even write a book? Are you even qualified enough? These are my talents: Business Owner [SBA]. Recognized by the United States of America [2020] Computer Scientist- Recognized by MIT [Started on my Mom's birthday and ended on my Sister's Birthday] as a Business Owner (UNGUARDED.com developed by Salman Zuberi Hussain[Salman Hasan] [Sal]) Content Creator [Visual Arts]- Documented Top Tier Athletes [HS/College]. 30+ documentaries and ongoing UNGUARDED Content Series by (Salman Zuberi Hussain [Salman Hasan] [Sal]) [Documenting my own life]. Writer (UNGUARDED.com [Diary] - By Salman Zuberi Hussain [Salman Hasan] [Sal]) Ex-Athlete [Basketball] (D3 Basketball/D2 JUCO). I have the potential to venture, so I will continue to progress. At the moment, I'm getting booed. Eventually, that will flip, so I will keep writing and progressing. Life is all about progressing and becoming the best version of yourself. This is me trying to be the best version of myself. My intention is right; I understand that the execution for one person seems too good to be true, but it's true. So I will continue to build. In 5-10 years, my legacy can be remembered as one of the greatest entrepreneurs if I continue to develop my life peacefully and focus on this company's growth. Although COVID-19 was crazy [2020-2024], I made massive progress because I learned how to program. Now, I have to fill the rest of the gaps, complete the mobile app, get the remaining assets, and $2,000-$3,000 monthly revenue. Thinking small will lead me to more significant victories.


How I Think- May 1st, 2024

So, every morning, I wake up and think about where I am in life with UNGUARDED. Today, my main focus is to see if I can get into an ICC Cricket Game as media like the old days before I got reversed with COVID-19. I'm happy I'm back from COVID-19 and focused on building this conglomerate daily. Once I complete my UNGUARDED goals, my next focus becomes making sure I wake my brain up and get ready for a workout in Princeton, New Jersey. Once my workout is complete, my corporate day starts. Today, my main focus will be creating a piece of art for next year to ensure that people follow my journey. I can continue this run until 34-35 at this pace because I have tremendous momentum and energy around me.


Cricket Game-May 1st, 2024

So my grandma took off for a flight to London as my family and I just dropped her off, and I also ran into my uncle at a restaurant. On June 9th, Pakistan vs. India is having a cricket game in the USA. If I can get a media pass to that game, that would be a dream come true as UNGUARDED is backrolling. I'm rolling my content/novel for now until potential scalability. I used to film NCAA college games in the USA, as my real passion is basketball. I am selfish, but I am not because I am always willing to complete the task of building a major conglomerate.


Investment Strategy-May 2nd, 2024

In a dream world, I run the world in the USA. Another great vision at this point is for the top Kobe Bryant fans to invest in UNGUARDED, and the direction focuses specifically on the greatness of UNGUARDED, and I work with the best of the best. That's my thought as this company continues to grow and evolve. The company's strategy is to complete the mobile app, get the remaining assets, and generate sales in the USA. Don't get delusional, as no one will come and save the day. To all my friends and colleagues, continue to build your assets, and venture scalability may be attained. I may be able to help people with this.


My Workout-May 2nd, 2024

They say every moment counts, so being sharp is essential in life no matter what you do. If you're doing construction, try to be the best construction worker you can be, and then take that attitude and build on your dreams, whether they say you're good enough or not. Today, my workout was what it needed to be: sharp and disciplined, and this just carried over to my new diary launch. I'm excited to continue writing about my life, document myself until I'm 80-90, and stay healthy. A lot is happening today, good and bad; my main focus is building a conglomerate. Allah blesses me, as I don't have to worry about much as I am a US citizen, so I will continue to document my life and my thought process and continue to make sure I stay tough in the head to make this conglomerate more advanced.


My Spirit-May 2nd, 2024

As I got older, I realized who you surround yourself with is essential. If you hang out with people who are not in the right mindset, what can happen is you naturally become like them. At heart, no one wants to work a full-time job [mostly], so now I know I must keep myself distant and build an upbeat mindset. I respect people who work full-time, as I am no better than them. I sit here and watch people go to work while I work on myself and build myself on this platform for the people who work so hard every day. I will continue to develop my heritage wealth one day at a time.


The Main Goal- May 3rd, 2024

The main goal of UNGUARDED is to become a conglomerate brand. The first step is to generate minimum monthly sales of $2,000-$3,000. Then, the following steps are attaining the assets from Meta, TikTok, X, and Twitch and fixing the SEO. Then, I have to work on developing better program assets. Then, I have to continue my rare content and diary. I'm creating a brand built around me. The business model/theory is an influencer-driven platform with me as the owner, scaling other content creators and building one base. A lot of my days are repeating, but it's important to keep on knocking on the door.


Adding Subscription- May 3rd, 2024

So, this is a challenging situation. As the owner, I'm stuck doing all the work, but now unguarded.com is online. This gives me the power in my life to continue to progress, to continue to shine, and to keep me motivated. I'll add a subscription system, enable user authentication, and do everything myself while I wait for a venture deal or corporate partnership. The risk on my end is the chance of the software crashing as I add more features. I'm trying to make the code as lean as possible, but I must be considerate of others and willing to collaborate with great Sports, Music, Entertainment, and Tech companies.


Sitting in Princeton- May 3rd, 2024

I'm sitting in Princeton, New Jersey, contemplating what I will do next. Should I continue to build out my diary? Should I make more content? Should I continue to build out more prototypes? I can do many things, but I must remember owning a digital distribution and maintaining it is my priority. I am blessed to express my life every day. The hard part becomes this for me. Should I raise capital or not? My decision is straightforward. I will hold and own 100% of UNGUARDED in the USA and focus on $2,000- $3,000 USD in revenue until a great opportunity is attained for this conglomerate. I'll also seek partnerships/budgets to make UNGUARDED a bigger brand. Then, I'll consider the maximum investment deals from overseas. PIF, Bahrain, etc...


Shooting Hoops- May 3rd, 2024

So I am happy as ever because I just shot 40/50 on the free-throw line and then 43/50, made 33 in a row, and went 1/2 from half-court. It's essential to get my mind right and let my stress out; basketball is how I do that, as I still have talent and love the game.


UNGUARDED- May 3rd, 2024

So what I should do for UNGUARDED is simple. Hire a tech agency to complete UNGUARDED NextJS and then UNGUARDED Expo React Native. Get the remaining assets. From there, continue to showcase the content and continue writing a diary. One day at a time. I decided to do this myself as now I know how to code.


Tutorial- May 3rd, 2024

The Internet, by far, is the most powerful tool on the planet. So look at this. A banking system can be made just by going on YouTube. This is how I learned how to make this website and then deploy it on the Internet. We all have the same 24 hours; it's about how you use yours. Imagine in 10 years how much information will be on the Internet?! UNGUARDED will still need marketing, sales, and collaborations, but this is maintainable and a great start. It is good to learn while I continue to develop my life.


Feeling a Bit Down- May 3rd, 2024

As time passes, I've lost/betrayed many of the people I documented in the past. I am trying to figure out how to repay them for all our experiences and fun times and vice versa. Time moves fast; I'm 29, and although I have a lot of hope in my life, how will the company UNGUARDED help people get jobs? I used to document many of the top athletes in the world, but I decided to bring everything in-house to create a better business model. It's time to grow others rather than document top tier.


The Situation- May 4th, 2024

As I get older, it becomes harder to continue chasing my dream. A lot of people in this world have dreams similar to mine. It's essential as I get older, I continue to chase mine. Many thought COVID-19 would be my defeat, but I have become more robust as I look back. I have a big platform where I can express my voice, so I must express my voice daily and continue to build UNGUARDED into the conglomerate it's supposed to be. These days, I'm self-centered, as I own UNGUARDED, as many people's lives have gone left and right, so I must focus on myself. A lot of the people around me at this time are older and stuck in situations where they aren't the happiest, so I must keep my spirit high and surround myself with people who can help me think of more concepts and evolve UNGUARDED. If it were up to me, I'd start scaling around myself as soon as possible. Office/Corporate Building/One Store[NJ/NYC], Products[Better Products], Content [Exclusive of me], Diary, Social Assets [Start scaling and building up for products] and then go from there. I'm alive and well; although I've slowed down documenting top-tier pros, I've focused on turning these memories into my legacy.


Pakistan Memories- May 4th, 2024

The wedding is going to be a great time. My cousin recently immigrated from Pakistan, which is fantastic to see. I always think about my family from Pakistan and our unforgettable memories. One of my favorite moments in Pakistan was when my cousin and I went to play soccer. I still remember scoring 5-6 goals, which I was shocked about as I spent more time crafting my basketball skillset. We didn't play on a field; we played in the dirt. I sometimes wonder how Pakistan is doing wealth-wise because I still remember how dirt poor it was back in Pakistan and how they used to beg for mango juice right in the street. I sometimes wish to travel privately worldwide and build out UNGUARDED as a conglomerate. Man, I miss those experiences. These experiences in the USA have been dull as I've lived here for a while. Although I don't take the USA for granted, I'm just getting bored on this journey, and people are annoying me with the be thankful aura. What I have is what I have. It's always about progression moving forward and helping as much as possible.


Wedding- May 4th, 2024

So the wedding was great today. There were a lot of new faces, so I had to leave the party, and all sorts of weird things were going on because they had to keep me healthy these days. Sometimes, I get tampered with here and there, but that's because of my potential. I know who I am, and I didn't disappoint this time. I made UNGUARDED.com myself, which is deployed on the internet. I created the content myself. Also, my sister and I had a great conversation at the wedding about where she wanted to go in life as she owns her own life. I'm proud of her. These memories count as I remember her saying her first words and all these adorable moments. There's a 10-year gap between us; I'm old.


How I'm Living- May 5th, 2024

At the moment, I'm living down to earth. Still, in the same house, I grew up with my parents and sister, but I am wealthier than ever. I'm happy that I own my assets for UNGUARDED, besides a few that will be handed over when the time is right. Many people put their time into me, so I'm hoping to make my big dreams come true. Buy an item if you want to support me through this restructuring and advancement process. I do consider VC to be a possibility. Sales revenue direct so that's good news.


Dubai- May 5th, 2024

I'm old now. 29 years old. I was sellable at 16; now, I'm an entrepreneur. My favorite parts of Dubai were the Burj Khalifa, IMG World, and Ferrari World. Dubai is wonderful, and I would love to be there again. I hope to meet for investment one day. There is so much life ahead of me. You never know; I may have access to the kingdom's palace, and they let me use their assets to build UNGUARDED, and we build together. For example, I go overseas, they let me use their kingdom key to drive a car, and then I get to stay at the palace while building this dream. You never know.


Education- May 6th, 2024

Education is the key to success. I know it's one of those sayings that everyone says as a kid, and we all nod and move forward with our day, but it is. As people, we're programmed and wired to chase capital. For example, when I go to a family function, one of the first things people want to know is what are you doing for a living. When it comes to marriage, how much do you make, but have people considered their job security? People get comfortable counting capital, then poof, job gone or business gone, and then what does one do next? Hence, I stress education over money; an educated person can put money aside, invest in himself/herself and what he/she knows, build around capital, and use it as a resource. For example, I can work for Meta as a software engineer, but since I invested in education, my mind bought the IP, and now I use my knowledge to develop my program for the IP and my base. So now I'm using my education to read, write, and create a diary on an expensive IP. I'm also releasing exclusive content on this IP and myself. Ten years later, my name is built and heritage wealth is there, and I am worth more than the average due to my education. Education is everything.


The Day I Saw a Gunshot- May 6th, 2024

So I went to a game to document Juju Murray in the Bronx, and I was excited because Juju Murray came with much notoriety in the community and was a big name in HS. Also, I am a huge basketball fanatic at heart. I can't lie. I brought all my media equipment and walked into the gym. Everyone was excited for the show, as this game had a lot of hype. Famous figure Chris Brickley was there as well. All the media was there. As I was there filming, going back and forth side to side, trying to get the best angles I could for the game, I was standing filming, and out of nowhere, someone ran in and shot the game. I vividly remember standing there with my jaw open and then going to the right corner like all the media guys ducking the gunshots. Since then, I realized I'm better off building my life with UNGUARDED for now and going from there. UNGUARDED will get there as I continue developing my life on this website. I'll allocate these funds to invest in Sports, Music, and Entertainment culture. I realized that next time, I better come with some funds. I returned to the Bronx and tried again with Ian Jackson because things were stagnant, and I wanted to see how people were doing in the community, but I realized they would only be interested if it were corporate or big big-time. It was time to start my venture with UNGUARDED and use all the content for my basketball legacy.


Back Home- May 6th, 2024

Today, I'm blessed to be back in the Princeton community every single day. The issue in my life is that I'm wealthy compared to the regular individual, and with that comes big responsibility. So I own UNGUARDED right here in the USA. 2-3k wire, and I am blessed. No one is hiring anyone at this time. When capital comes in, or I have corporate partnerships and investments, I'll help people get employed.


Progress- May 7th, 2024

So, one day at a time, I progress as a person. What is next in my life? I do own this platform. Own. Obviously, we have to use other people's tools to own something so I constructed and engineered these tools together to build a linear supply chain so that more people can be helped. The music is a huge tool and I am grateful so I put in the work to get things done. The name is enormous, and I know I'm the right person who's supposed to own UNGUARDED. I have a store that is located in the USA, I'm a US citizen, but a lot of people want a capital raise, and I do feel that pressure from all the corporates, so I hope overseas helps me take care of that issue so UNGUARDED is a big conglomerate like I dreamed.


Programming- May 7th, 2024

So, from 2020 to 2024, I learned how to program. It was one of the best things I could've done for my life, as I was able to program UNGUARDED myself. Now that I own UNGUARDED myself 100%, I hold all the assets in the United States of America. From there, I have to see what's best for the company's growth because the United States of America, unless they want to make a particular investment in me, usually do not give capital directly to people; they provide freedom to own businesses and go towards Venture Capital and aim to either IPO or flip the company. With this company, I would instead raise capital from overseas to retain the assets and have one NJ/NY base and scale from there. [Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, etc]. Otherwise, I'll look for partnerships directly to scale the company in the USA. Nothing yet, but I am building. I am going to continue to improve the website I made, as well as the mobile app.


My Downfalls- May 8th, 2024

So, as a kid, I look back; I used to mess around a bit too much. Nothing crazy alarming where I can be in jail or anything like that, but I look back and see how much time I wasted. I spent countless hours on the basketball court; I could've easily spent that time learning how to program or learning a new trait on the basketball court. Luckily for me, from 21 onwards, I learned how to create content and manage a small business, and now I have learned how to program rapid drive. This gives me the ability to speak about my life extensively. I'm blessed and thankful and look forward to UNGUARDED's progress and my progress as an individual. I'm only 29, but many top-tier entrepreneurs have gotten a head start compared to me, so now I'm behind. But better later than never. There are so many directions I can go with this, so I will continue pushing forward harder.


My Tendencies- May 8th, 2024

I was always fascinated by things that amazed people. I'm still the same way. I've never lived a slow-paced life; I've always lived a dream life. So, I am adjusting to this life where things are stagnant and boring. In business, selling a wow factor is essential; otherwise, people don't care. Think of a kid. A kid is fascinated by fancy cars, significant buildings, and elegant things. At this time, my wow's are way too mature. So, let's take a look at my wows. The first wow in my life is, wow, you created this business model yourself?! The answer is yes. The second wow is, wow, you made the content yourself?! The answer is yes. The third wow is, wow, you programmed UNGUARDED.com yourself?! The answer is yes. The fourth wow is, wow, you have people who make music about your legacy and life who are famous. The answer is yes. The fifth wow is, wow, you're writing your diary yourself, the answer is yes. This wow is scary, so I'm mentally preparing people for it because it knocks everyone out of the park. These are the wow's in my life. Unless I have sales or a serious corporate partnership, the next wow is out of my control.


The Way My Entrepreneurial Life Works- May 8th, 2024

I will get right to it, as people are probably busy with work. It starts when you fall in love with a dream to help many people. From there, you start your dream and get a lot of excitement. "I'm excited; this is going to be great." From there, you stick it through and get more excitement. The exciting times simmer down fast, and things become stagnant. This is where a lot of people break. So, the idea is to continue no matter what. It can all be gone if you need to adjust faster. Then, the adjustment is made, and you're in the driver's seat. Then you realize I have too many responsibilities, and that's when you usually get others who think like you to solve these issues. Then you find out they might not want to solve these issues, and then you readjust again. Then, you put yourself in a new driver's seat after a more significant adjustment. The more readjustments, the more complex it is to get you off your primary entrepreneurial mission. So, let's take a look at my life. I started documenting athletes with a story because I love basketball, and my basketball dreams didn't work out. From there, I document some top HS/College talent, and then they create traction. So now people in the community know what UNGUARDED is. Then, everyone takes notice and clings on from there due to the potential of scalability. In 2020, I get reset. Then, I continued to do the same thing: I was supposed to adjust to the new challenges people wanted me to face. Then I go crazy because I'm wired only to create content. Then I reset, learn a new trait, coding, and return to my corporate ways. I bought the necessary IPs and social platforms that I needed for UNGUARDED, thanks to my family's help. From there, I create my own driver seat and program the IP myself. Then I realized there might be a need for IT, and there might be a need for more hands. Then I readjust again and think of a program that I can make more efficient, so this way, there will be less annoyance and scalability issues. From there, I realized that if I got out of my own head and sold my story, I could flip all my hard work and time spent creating content and building @theunguarded into notoriety and more relationships, especially since I'm still independent. I'm in the VC space, sitting comfortably with items to sell and ownership. If you look back, it all started because I loved basketball. Now it's me with an IP that I programmed myself, my legacy story that matters to many, UNGUARDED on Youtube, UNGUARDED on Snapchat, UNGUARDED on Bereal, and UNGUARDED on Linkedin. Now, I'm connected to overseas investors/VCs to fill the gaps in my issues, which, in the grand scheme, are small and have built a ton of capital leverage. In life, you should chase something you love because it can lead to big things such as International Investment and notoriety from people I used to look up to. To be honest, it's insane to even to think about and I'm really grateful. Rather than say wow and get comfortable, I have to compete and do something that hasn't been done before to live up to this wow. I own this company and want to see if I can be in VC territory without a raise and scale revenue way at heart. It might be too tricky, but I will adjust. Hence, I can sit here and, if this scales, ask for founder credit and kick everyone out because my story is authentic and then help out.


Untitled- May 8th, 2024

If it were up to me, I'd scale UNGUARDED with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, and all the Muslim countries in the USA, and then be in every country in the world. Please let me know if you have something enticing, like a partnership/collaboration in the USA. I understand everyone at soul wants the next big conglomerate and something new and exciting. A new way of building a conglomerate and a new corporate culture. Getting ready to bring that to the table!


Take the Time to Appreciate Your Surroundings- May 9th, 2024

So yesterday, I took a walk around Princeton. Something I take for granted is how beautiful Princeton is. The views are breathtaking. I feel like a tiny artist, but I always have big thoughts. The sculptures in Princeton are beautiful; I can only imagine making something like that. I just watched Tyla's video and Bia & J Cole's video which showcased similar infrastructure. It made me realize how I must generate revenue, scale capital, or close investments to create a team that will enhance UNGUARDED in the future. We'll see, as these are my interests at the moment. I landed a connection yesterday on Linkedin to close investment, and I am grateful, but if we're connecting, I must ensure that things get done for UNGUARDED. I don't like false hope for my neighbors, the community of NJ, and the community of SB/Princeton, as that's where I reside every day, and I get the same question asked every day. Let's see if I can land great partnerships, investments, or some revenue.


Partnership and/or a job- May 9th, 2024

A quick question: what's more important in my life? Collaboration with a top-tier brand or a job with w/a tech firm paying $100,000 a month? I think both at the same time would be awesome. I can be working on unguarded while working for a tech firm. This thought runs through my mind every day.


Progress- May 9th, 2024

Life is long, and I have to continue to build day in and day out. I love the fact that I'm able to express my story online every single day. This is how I stay in touch with the people I knew from HS. I know everyone has progressed in their lives. I wish to help these people more, but there's only so much I can do besides continuing to build this brand using my likeness and seeing people wanting to collaborate. I look back and thank god I went to school and chased my dreams because now I can share my words on my platform. Self-expression is vital, so this is how I can express myself.


Money- May 9th, 2024

In any country in the world, money is essential. It keeps the house running and keeps many motivated, but it also divides us from each other. Let's say everyone in the world has money. How would we treat each other? More of equals. As someone who cares for people, I want people to think about what they can bring to the table for their own lives to create their wealth. Top tier salaries in the world for the top 10% of the world is $200,000 a year. In 30-40 years, they will bring in $6,000,000. That is extremely impressive, but what is $12,000,000 going to do for me? Consider most likely a high amount going to taxes, and then consider lifestyle choices due to the people I'll be around. Most likely, that person will be living in the middle-class sector unless they use their salary to invest in assets. Now, let's say I have $6,000,000 dollars. $1,000,000 would go straight to IP/Tech. Then, $1,000,000 would be used to influence scale content creators, etc..., but the revenue generated will likely be within the capital injected into the company, forcing consistent over-leverage. I own UNGUARDED, and I have a platform to showcase my voice daily. Money is a resource. If my influence builds and I can generate $2,000-$3,000 a month, I can collaborate with people who have value and can help me generate more revenue.


Basketball- May 10th, 2024

Basketball was the love of my life for about 26-28 years. I spent endless hours on a basketball court. Now that I'm older, I have to let it go, but that doesn't mean I will stop playing basketball because it's my way of letting go of stress and staying sharp and healthy. At this point in my life, I have to stay sharp as it's essential to progress my life, but in the back of my mind, I think I could still go pro. Maybe in Saudi, UAE, or Turkey for a 1-year UNGUARDED stint; it would be entertaining, and it would sell tickets. Probably not as I'm focused on other aspects of my life. Basketball is a great way to get space from others as it's an to progress as an individual. Now, I'm building my own brands, and although making the NBA or a professional league didn't happen, I'm doing pretty well. I learned a lot from my basketball journey. My favorite moves for a point guard are the side step/step-back three, between the legs, behind the back in transition, and the rondo. Advice for basketball players who are point guards is to be scoring-driven first. At this point, I'm a tech geek, content creator, above-average athlete, and entrepreneur. Basketball will always be a part of my life, but I must progress my life forward.


Art- May 10th, 2024

What is more powerful than money, art. Art is more powerful than money. Great art can inspire someone to buy something and can inspire someone to better their lives. Art is the most powerful thing on earth as it holds influence, so as I progress as an artist, I have to make sure people understand what my artwork is showcasing. My artwork showcases my true life story every day. Why is my story so significant compared to other stories? In my life, I intend to create something bigger than myself, and I must create change in this world compared to the average individual. Who knows, maybe the artwork inspires someone to buy something. In addition, the way life works is if I continue to progress day in and day out, my story's net value will increase while everyone else's value grows as well. So, I must continue improving my life daily and expressing my story.


Corporate Values- May 10th, 2024

Although I'm technically in the same loop as all the corporates and am a small business, here are my corporate values. The first corporate value is 1. Ensure the employee feels the same empathy about an organization as the owner. 2. Make sure that if you work for a corporation, you at least love the position/role given. 3. Always make employees feel job security because it ensures they can put food on the table 4. Freedom thinking time. Always let the employee grow their own lives; roles are always replaceable, so let people explore their own lives, see what they can bring to the organization, close budgets/bonuses for these ideas, and let them leave. 5. Real Sympathy. Ensure you develop feelings for your employees and allow them to do what they love. If they don't love the role, see where you can put them to adjust. If I had capital, this is how I'd run my organization. Recommended Schedule 1. Workout 2. Arrive to work 3. Meeting with the team to discuss the needs to deliver. 4. Work on the tasks that need to be completed 5. Lunch Time 6. Freedom Time [Concepts to pitch concepts to the head of each department] 7. Leave office 8. Take care of your family and enjoy life. Friday would be a particular day. Financial checkups [Mandatory], Mental Health checkups [Mandatory], Mandatory Concept Pitch Meeting [Mandatory], Meetup [Mingle time] [Mandatory].


Opening the Doors/Gates- May 10th, 2024

So, I'll be sincere and get straight to it. Many wished I could get to filming an NBA game. I am not there yet, but hopefully, I will be soon. I need my supporters to understand that the reason why these doors and gates are closed is because I own 100% of UNGUARDED at the moment; I do have some rareness to me in sports, music, and entertainment, but the doors only open if equity is worked on with others and so forth. I am keeping UNGUARDED and waiting for a significant investment to put a roof over my head besides my family's house. I am Muslim, so I am waiting for PIF to get this investment done with me or for a top-tier brand or talent to collaborate with me so UNGUARDED can work. I am still a US citizen. I went to a Knicks game to put more pressure and speed up this process with all I've accomplished. What would help me get this investment in is more walk-in walkouts and growth in the USA.


Food- May 11th, 2024

If you research me and take the time to get to know me, I get attached to people. I've been eating the same pasta for years, and to be honest, I hate trying new food. My health is something I value a lot, and they say what you put in your body is what you become. Although my body isn't built the best, it is above average compared to many. I can type all these great thoughts due to hard work, consistency, and a healthy diet. These little things add up day by day. I don't make many exceptions, although I do for dinner these days as my mom and dad are getting old. I do have to watch myself sometimes. You can see me in Princeton eating Efes or see me at home eating desi food, right at home. I'm blessed to be eating free, have a home with my family, and build out my dream every day. Think about all the kids in Africa and Pakistan who don't have access to food. One of my favorite moments was when I gave a man money to buy a full plate of biryani. The number of kids who ran to that food was insane, putting tears in my eyes. Now that I'm in Princeton, New Jersey since Princeton is a well-off town, I must remember where I come from and the hardship it took for my family to get here. This doesn't mean I sit comfortably; I must continue growing.


Prayer- May 11th, 2024

Although I don't know Arabic yet and know some of the alphabet, Islam is one of those religions that brings me peace. I hate prayer, though. I'll be sincere, but due to Islamic law, I must read Namaz no matter what. I like praying alone these days, which in Islam isn't recommended. I have my reasons. I live in the USA, and almost everyone is stuck at work, so I like being alone and praying until I find a real team willing to build around me. I want to pray with people with the same spiritual mission as me, not those who are causing havoc in my life and my dreams daily. Like any human, I feel sad when people go against my dreams. I won't retaliate or anything like that, but I will still build every day for my main dream in life. I have to make my dream come true first; then, I'll focus more on my Islamic journey when UNGUARDED is taken care of because this is real life, and UNGUARDED can scale and help more people. It's Muslim owned with me at the moment, aligning with Saudi Arabia, London/UK, and the USA. I expect capital to grow UNGUARDED. If a Christian can do a job better than a Muslim, I'll have to hire him. The same goes for even if the person doesn't believe in god. I'll have to hire that person, and we will respect the person delivering for the company. I dream of building 1 NJ/NY base in the USA, aligning investment with Saudi Arabia, and going from there. Please don't associate any riots, protests, or movements with me. I have my opinions. Read my diary. I understand where people come from, but I am not a revolt leader.


Fasting Experience- May 11th, 2024

So I did keep all my Rosa's this year. For people who don't know what that is, it's when someone fasts for Allah [god]. Sunrise, the sun comes up, and a Muslim is not allowed to eat until sundown. Taraweeh's were complicated this year, as many didn't expect me to be there, but I still got it done. As I progress as a human being, I realize that as I get older, fewer and fewer people will support me in the local community because my situation is better than theirs. I must continue developing my Muslim strength and keep writing these diaries. So many people are busy judging me and my character but do not realize they can build their lights and passions and eventually work for me. Not everything is about money; it's about having a lasting impact and providing real opportunities for people. Working for me would be a blessing if I had access to the capital I need, but what happens when you take capital? Then, the investor needs to return. Then, the art dies, and it becomes more focused on centralized visions. This means a broader vision that can be way more than an influencer brand of my life. Then it becomes churn churn churn. So if it has to go that way, again, I'll give theories, and the execution of those theories will be up to the investors and people who work for UNGUARDED. Again, I am not associated with riots or protests or have anything to do with being a revolt leader. With money comes more issues, such as people latching on, messing around with health, etc.


The Situation in Our World- May 11th, 2024

So these days, times are callous for any entrepreneur, especially me. Since 2019, there have been so many revolts in the world it's not even funny. From Black Lives Matter to Palestine vs. Israel to Russia vs Ukraine, these revolts have been a killer for small businesses and companies trying to evolve their companies. So now this is a big issue for me; I own UNGUARDED, and it's a scalable business, so how do you guys see the issue? On one end, I'm trying to raise capital from Saudi Arabia with private investment, and wars are going on everywhere. So, I am still running in the USA, but I have to do what's best for my life. One day at a time, I'm continuing to build my legacy every day on UNGUARDED. So it sucks because the people I know become minuscule as I grow every day, so now it's essential to use my light to elevate. This is how I build my light. I write a diary, create content and programs, and run a small business. I still am running my business, and it's life, so it's sad because I'll still have to run my business UNGUARDED regardless in the USA until someone wants to scale.


Marriage- May 11th, 2024

Marriage. This topic scares me as the women in my past were great women, but it was unsuitable for them as I always loved chasing my dreams. It's been 4.5 years, and I'm looking for a wife. But before a wife, I will close investment/corporate partnerships and revenue and sign a prenup, LOL. Joking here, the woman would get half, but she would have to bring something to the table. So once my life is settled with UNGUARDED, I shall happily get married. Although my life is pretty settled compared to many others, I will consider all the responsibilities and costs if I get married. Think about the cost of marriage. Think about the price of the honeymoon. Think about the cost of having a kid. Think about how life becomes about the kid. Think about how I'll have to slow down this business and have it work more for me. It would be nice if it slowed down first, and then I married a woman before I split half of my assets. Jokes aside, I'll probably have a particular clause, as that is one of my biggest fears about getting divorced. If a woman brings more to the table than UNGUARDED and is a businesswoman, I'll be interested because she's financially stable. Then, we can continue to build together. So, I'm looking for a bright, resilient woman and an owner who lives humbly. I prefer Muslim women, and if I'm attracted to the woman, then I'll consider marrying her. Every woman is beautiful, but I have a type. I'm 5'10, so preferably a woman my size. Marriage.

Movement of the IP- May 12th, 2024

So, there is a small venture war going on at the moment. I promise one base in NJ/NY for UNGUARDED, but my promise doesn't mean anything without any finances to scale the company. I need to close this venture deal myself and have everyone out of the way. Otherwise, this will be stuck here. The IP is in London until this company can get a VC/Big Investment. The store is live and portable.


The Potential- May 12th, 2024

So now this is the thing. UNGUARDED is such a beautiful name. UNGUARDED can be much more than basketball and I. It can be a banking system, a theme park, a social media app, or a dynasty. I own this, which is excellent. This is my resume for now as I programmed and wired this website. Imagine UNGUARDED gets its own VC fund from overseas; imagine it's a theme park, imagine, etc. The possibilities are endless.


Mother's Day- May 12th, 2024

Mother's Day. Although my mom/grandmother and I love each other these days, I'm annoyed because I don't like where UNGUARDED is as a conglomerate. It needs to progress because now it's starting to feel like a burden to my family and I. I love working on this, but I want my life to grow and this company to grow substantially. I build this daily, but I wish I could spoil my mom more. I'll repay her once UNGUARDED becomes what I expect it to become. How to Scale Art-May 13th, 2024 An artist at heart cares about what they make. They don't care about money; although they want to be compensated, they care more about their perceptions or what they put out about themselves—the representation of who they are. So, when I make art, I'm showcasing who I am. What I represent is why a lot of people gravitate towards me. I showcase my life and my entrepreneurial journey every day. It's essential in corporate culture to understand that the artist comes first, so when the piece of art is sold, it can generate a return.


How do I Get My Art To Live On- May 13th, 2024

By not caring about the art, caring more about what I can sell. What I'm selling to you guys is an illusion of fantasy. It's a fantasy that I'll be able to create an IMG world with UNGUARDED or a Ferrari world with UNGUARDED, but is it a delusion? Even I don't know if it's a delusion or not. I do see the wow factor. Can my wow factor translate to sales? Unless people want to drive sales directly, it will be tough because we're going against banks that over leverage and conglomerates that over leverage every day and create that wow. So my wow is wow, I'm a one-person show, showcasing who I am on the platform I own, but now that wow needs to be something like a Ferrari world. I work with my family and live right at home, so it's easy for me to get a capital raise from overseas.


My Political Views- May 13th, 2024

To be honest, my political views in the USA don't matter because I own a business right here and live in the The USA. I am driven to hire people and provide opportunities. My concern is how I can use my light, UNGUARDED, to help people and develop this business because this is the only way I can help others elevate their lives and mine. Why does it matter to me as long as the country is safe and sound? I understand that aligning with political campaigns as I age is essential, but so is this business. I want to see what I can do to help UNGUARDED grow rather than focus my life on politics. I am independent at this point because I want to see more income for urban communities, but at the same time, there needs to be a limit there. Otherwise, things can go out of control because urban communities are stuck in urban community situations. I have a new concept that is mighty important for the USA. Investment fund for conglomerates. This way, they can help the USA grow and hire everyone within, just like all the other countries. Things are different in America, as international competition is increasing, such as the FIFA World Cup, ICC Cricket, etc. The USA is becoming more of a central zone with all countries. As far as UNGUARDED, I can venture the company out, but then I'll be fighting for an IPO and an acquisition, and the culture becomes irrelevant. Also, ventures are about return and saving costs, so they'll always look for the cheapest way to get things done.


Financial Literacy- May 14th, 2024

Financial literacy is not just critical; it's crucial in this world. As kids, we're programmed in every country to think about how to make money. Understanding how money works and how to manage it effectively can empower us to make informed decisions about our future. So, what's the best way to make money? I suggest going to school, getting your degree, and then getting a 6 figure job and financing your life in the USA. But one has to think, what if I chase my dream and passion? The possibilities when you do that are endless. So, let's take a look at example one. A person makes 20,000 dollars a month. If the man/woman spends their money right, they can invest in stocks, bonds, etc..., and build an outstanding portfolio to finance their own life. Let's take a look at example two. A person takes their time, lives off $2,000 a month, builds a brand off the ground and learns all sorts of traits to ensure they own the business. Who is the more affluent person? This is opinionated, but from my perspective, the person who is taking the time to invest in their dream. If the person has patience and perseveres, they can build a base. Once the base is constructed, the person can start charging using the base. Then, if the base catches traction, they can partner and collaborate with people who can change the company's trajectory. If the person continues their dream chase, they will most likely know a lot of traits, as it takes time and effort to fund your dreams, so that person will most likely wear many hats. The worst-case scenario is that person, if they pursue their dream for a long time, will most likely be job-ready in many sectors, six figures. So it's always good to pursue your dreams , but be prepared for hell, as many don't want that to happen.


The Shadow King[Novel]- May 14th, 2024

The shadow always follows you wherever you go. The shadow never lies. We all take our shadow wherever we go: the good, the bad, the evil. I live and learn from my shadow. I don't run away from my shadow. But what is the shadow? The shadow is your spirit, which keeps the soul alive. The more you stay true to yourself, the more your shadow stays near you. Why is that important? If you remain true to your shadow, you have internal peace. You have something to live for. You have something to wake up for and be excited about every day. Remember to stay near your shadow/spirit as each day goes by. People will throw you in one category, especially when you get older because we're wired to think about how to provide and sustain income. It's important to chase your childhood shadow.


Art Is Opinionated- May 14th, 2024

Art is opinionated. Some are going to say my art is "trash". Some are going to say my art is great. Who the heck cares. It's all opinions. That's anything in life. Here's the thing though, the more I distribute my art on this platform, the more my legacy will be remembered and the more chances of big dreams coming true.


Discipline- May 15th, 2024

One of the most essential principles of life. If you have this trait, you can accomplish anything in life. Think of this story. There is a guy who has to feed his family. Each day, he goes to the water well. When he goes to the water well, he gets compensated an extra 30 ounces to his previous 120 ounces. On the first day, he goes to the water well and is compensated 120 ounces, the amount his family needs to survive. Then, the next day, 150 ounces. The kid goes to the well every day for ten years. Think about how much water he has accumulated. If the kid keeps a disciplined head through the ten years, they will have a fortune of water. To be exact, 109,620 ounces of water were used for his family and, at this point, his tribe. The kid started with 120 ounces. That's how life works.

Pacing Your Life- May 15th, 2024

There's this critical quote from Kobe Bryant about staying in the present moment and enjoying your life at the time. The past is the past; the future is the future, but what about the time we have now to live and breathe? Enjoy the moments; enjoy the greatness you're achieving, as these moments in life are everything. God willing, I have many more excellent moments. Recently, in 2022, I went to Saudi Arabia, and it was a great time. I wish I looked better, but I didn't look the best. In Umrah, the tradition is to walk around the Kaaba seven times. This is a representation of the seven heavens. While walking, I noticed how many nasty thoughts came out of my head as I walked counterclockwise. That's because I was developing new spirituality. This Umrah was way more challenging to walk, but it taught me something. Pacing my journey is critical as time stops for no one. I continue to grow my life step by step, and I have to enjoy the moments.


Drawing the Line-May 15th,2024

As one gets older, it gets much more challenging to remain disciplined. At 15-16, it's easier, but what happens if you're not generating money for someone else or returning it? Then it becomes way more complicated as naysayers come in left and right and say get a job, bro. Do this, do that. This is when it's important to remind myself of my childhood self and continue my arduous pursuit. If you read my diary/novel entry earlier, I have lived daily like the boy going to the water well. It's a tedious pursuit, but from age 21 to now, the progress I've made is insane. From a small dream to VC territory, owning my assets, and being financially stable. I draw the line on naysayers. That energy is something I don't need around, and I am not forgiving as this pursuit is not easy, especially at age 29. Things are growing daily, so I must stay at my pace. Also, think about when we get older; there are fewer people in this world that we know, so moving forward becomes a tad difficult, especially if you cannot stay near the people who are progressing. Eventually, that lousy energy will start to turn into energy where they appreciate what I do rather than be upset, but that will require education for them to understand. I'll continue to develop this company one day at a time, but great things can't be built alone, so this is my transition to working with people with the same mindset.


UNGUARDED Assets-May 15th,2024

I have just bought UNGUARDED.TV, UNGUARDED.App, UNGUARDED.Store, and UNGUARDED.AI. I take these things for granted. I am so blessed. This leads me closer to my dreams. Locked in the USA, waiting for overseas investment as many might lead me that way.One day at a time, i'm going to be trying to unlock my potential and put myself in a better situation to help my family. I do believe this company is venture potential and there are many reasons why. I come with culture, I also come with education, and I also come with many people in the community who get annoyed with me, but at the end of the day love my family and I. I know as this keeps progressing, things get scarier and scarier because money is involved but remember, i'm an entrepreneur star. Yeah, I might have some equity in the future but at the end of the day but I am not that cash driven, this company should be employing people. I need one NJ/NY base for my legacy and then whatever happens in the west can happen in the west.[Overseas (PIF/Bahrain/etc..)]


Authenticity-May 16th, 2024

Authenticity is one of the most essential elements in building a brand. When someone is buying something that is not mainstream yet, they want to know what the person represents, what he/she has accomplished, and why I am buying from him/her instead of Nike or Amazon. So, I am authentic at this time. I have not received any investment or any help directly compared to Disney or compared to top-tier conglomerates. A few people in the mainstream have recognized me for all the time I have put in to help the urban community. At this time, the metropolitan community and basketball are closing off on me, and I'm exploring a new part of myself. UNGUARDED. What started with mixtapes for the youth [basketball] is now in VC territory because I can program and have tapped into my nerd self. Although not from the urban community, I have also paid my dues there to show love for the culture. Currently, UNGUARDED is all me with limited help from the community, so these sales will help. Now I think to myself, well, I love the culture, but will the culture buy into my vision of creating my own empire in the community? Most likely not because, in the community, most people want to pride themselves on their ownership and their own empires. It's time for me to leave the culture behind and make this name go mainstream. Now, I'm aligning UNGUARDED with overseas Muslim investors who are way well off compared to me. Hopefully, they can help me take UNGUARDED to the next level and partly invest into some of the metropolitan community that I worked with.


What Do You Pride Yourself On?- May 16th, 2024

Everyone in this world has an ego. Everyone in this world has pride. Everyone in this world wants to feel appreciated. What do you pride yourself on? Do you pride yourself based on your wealth? Do you pride yourself based on your health? Do you pride yourself based on your talent? Everyone prides themselves off something. These days I pride myself based on UNGUARDED. I want this to be the most prominent brand it can be, and I want my legacy to be remembered with it. I'm 29. By 35, I expect to be VC competitive. I have set the base up for my success and I am headed the right way. I have to be prideful. I have to have an ego. People are so caught up in my world, that they forget about how many companies and brands there are in this world. I'm competitive and always remember that one day I can be on the top, but the next day, not even remembered. NYC is really the jungle and to stand out in the jungle means I stand out in the whole world.


Scalability- May 16th, 2024

In any venture, thinking about how your company can help people globally is essential. Some may want to stay small, but UNGUARDED is meant for venture. So when thinking about global scale, one has to believe as linearly as possible, especially when you don't have the resources. Many people with experience may view this website and think I can do the same thing. They might look at the camera work and say I can do the same thing. They must understand the time and effort it takes to learn and maintain these assets. What if the computer program crashes? What if the hard drive crashes? What if my health isn't maintained? Since I run this alone, the audience might take things for granted, but they would cost a minimum of $1,000,000 a year to develop and maintain. It's easy to take my work and my consistency for granted. Still, I have built a lean and sustainable system for 3-5 years ahead, where I won't have to worry about crazy advancements; now, I'm looking for a minimum $10,000,000 seed round, maybe more. I wouldn't take $1,000,000 a year, obviously from a seed round, but that is the worth of effort I am putting in if I was appropriately compensated. Money is an object; I don't chase money; I look at money as a resource. I need money to slowly scale my vision of what I'm creating rather than throwing a bunch of capital at me, then losing control and going nowhere fast. The first thing that needs to be taken care of is programming if I have access to capital while developing my name with UNGUARDED. If I can take care of the programming aspect lean, efficient, and simple, then the company can focus more on slowly developing talent and products. The idea of this company is to stay lean and efficient and build a brand. Although I'm doing the exact opposite of scalability, this is how a conglomerate can be built: by building around people first and lining up the infrastructure before developing the brand. Since I worked on developing the brand and my likeness in the community, I can use myself for UNGUARDED, develop this company, and start scaling around my concepts. I'm documenting my own story rather than that of top-tier athletes because I have to build linear before investing time and effort into kids. It's not about basketball anymore; it's more about where I started from, my resources, and what I've accomplished compared to the regular person with my resources in this field. If you look at the overall aspect, there is a reason why I'm documenting my story rather than focusing on others. It took me about 8-9 years to certify myself, as I don't co-sign people quickly in the sports community and am strict regarding judging talent and putting my time and effort into people. With this big name, kids are not worth my time to document any more because the story becomes stagnant, and the same goes for all of them chasing the same dream. Unless there's something rare that they have accomplished or something rare about them that is interesting. I should use my story and educate the youth on how to build their lives rather than tell stories of top-tier athletes aiming to go pro repeatedly. The direction of UNGUARDED is going to be simple. It's going to focus on my story and then, from there, focus on tech development. Once complete, it will focus on scalability around the concepts I like. Sports, Music, Tech, and Entertainment. Then UNGUARDED might go back into documenting top-tier talent, but this time, it might be talent that is in the pros or a top-tier facility that develops top-tier pros with the music that is about me. It's about achieving something, and trust me, I've achieved a ton more than the average individual as I write this novel about my life


Money- May 16th, 2024

Before I dive in, shout out to all the greats who have used this name UNGUARDED from Scottie Pippen, to Lenny Wilkens, Chris Herren [ESPN], Rachel Nichols [CNN], UNGUARDED[Brazil Movie/Ward], and many more, but the topic is money. So my simple advice is don't chase it. Chase your passion. If you chase your passion, money will gravitate towards you if not it will run away from you. The more I continue my dream of making UNGUARDED a conglomerate, the more chances of not only money but opportunities of scalable concepts coming to me. Things do take time because these are big names, so i have to work with overseas PIF, UAE, Turkey, Bahrain [Muslim Countries] to line up right in the USA to create a more peaceful world. My store is live and eventually this will be a conglomerate and i'll be the founder, you're witnessing my journey of trying to complete this crazy task day by day. What seemed crazy is now a reality.


Keeping in Touch-May 17th, 2024

As i've gotten older, I've had difficult time keeping up with old classmates, community and friends. It's because I've been on this journey for 8-9 years going for 10 years. I'm still working on UNGUARDED and the store is live. I see the bigger vision. I see that if I own this, then from there my heritage legacy can be built right in the USA. I'm only 29, think about when i'm 50. At 50 years old this brand can be the biggest brand in the world if I continue at this pace and stay strict with my vision of continuing to build. This can eventually be one of the biggest brands ever. Now on a really serious note, think about where this can go. If I align with people who want to sit there and have fun all day, then the company will be negated. If I align with people who want to deliver ideas, execute ideas, and are driven towards success, then my life will go that way. So I suggest that we align with people who are going to help this vision, rather than hurt it.


The Vision of UNGUARDED- May 17th, 2024

So the vision of UNGUARDED. The vision of UNGUARDED is to build out a linear conglomerate in the USA, based off my interests. What are my interests? Sports, Music, Entertainment, and Tech. How is this vision being built? I have collected many of the UNGUARDED assets and I own them in the USA. UNGUARDED.com is live, UNGUARDED on Youtube, Snapchat, Linkedin, and Bereal. I also have collected UNGUARDED.TV, UNGUARDED.AI, and UNGUARDED.Store. I am now marketing myself because there is a lot of buzz behind my name and potential as an entrepreneur. Now it's about the resources to build this brand and continuing to think of concepts that can generate revenue. Some simple concepts. Attaching artists, attaching athlete's, attaching top tier marketers,top tier programmers, there's a lot of potential. I see Amazon, I see Disney, I see Nike. That's what this is going to be. Waiting for oversea investors. I have programmed myself, I have generated some buzz in the sports/music/entertainment/tech industry, and now i'm marketing my story as I chase this.


Chrome Heart- May 17th, 2024

So I'm a loving individual only when it comes to people who share the same vision and goals as me. I do respect everyone but time is of the essence, especially at this age.When I was younger, spent a lot of time on basketball, now all that time is recouped. If someone has time to waste, then that means, they don't even value their lives. As each day goes by we only get older and older, and less time and time. I can't care deeply about people who are taking me away from my vision and goal of UNGUARDED in this world. In this world, it's about leaving your legacy behind. At the moment, i'm trying to make sure that my legacy is left the right way. I have to take life seriously, otherwise this company can be left in the water and so does my heritage legacy. It has to be top tier, alone.


Update- May 17th, 2024

Still waiting for investment. 45/50 from the free-throw line and 1/3 from half-court. 29 years of age. Time is being wasted, but the store is live in the USA. Buy Now. My main focus is to make $2,000 a month for UNGUARDED every month in the USA. It sounds funny, but I'll have brand credibility if I can make it. Buy now.Also great news, I launched a small AI chatbox and launched a small tv channel that i'll be working on to enhance. Enjoy my show.


Merchandise/This World- May 18th, 2024

Things have taken a long time. The reason is the supply chain. I do have plans to scale this conglomerate. I can make Sweatshirts, T-shirts, Hoodies, etc., but I have to consider how to venture this off. Owning it in this world where things move so fast, everyone is looking forward to the weekend, where everyone respects high-end things; it's going to be tough to continue Queens Street Visions. So now, I'm thinking small for my life and thinking about how my legacy can be remembered. At this time, generating sales and creating substantial relationships to close revenue are challenging. Many keep saying the potential is endless, but that's only potential; as each day goes by, the "potential." decreases, and this becomes real life. I'll be fine, obviously, and patient, but the name UNGUARDED is supposed to help people, not sit here and stagnate. This will continue forward.


The Kid in Me- May 18th, 2024

So, the kid in me expects a million dollars and the fanciest things in the world. Expect a big house, fancy cars, beautiful women, and top-tier luxury. So, the older version of me tells the kid that what if we make a company that can build these fancy things rather than buy? The older version of me is telling the kid we can own a company and work with those who make fancy companies. Rather than chase money, focus on building something that can catch the eye of these fancy companies. Then, I can have my own fancy company and make them buy my fancy things while collaborating with fancy companies. The boy now knows that it's not about purchasing luxury items; it's about building things that can lead to my own company. I might not be able to do all the cool stuff that others are doing in luxury, but I'll be closer than the regular individual to collaborate with these fancy companies that I would love to work with. This is real life.


Getting a Job- May 18th, 2024

So, as I sit here typing this, there's a spirit next to me that shouldn't even be near me that says I hate that guy. My people, I don't care if you like me. I will still be writing my diary/novel and expressing my light every day because this is the purpose of life, and maybe your kid runs into it and is inspired by my words and learn something that can enhance their future. It's about helping people and uplifting people, not putting them down for no reason. If someone has the time to do that, they don't value themselves and have nothing better to focus on. That means I got them to think about what I'm up to rather than themselves. So, I'll continue focusing on myself since they're thinking about me now.


Your Surroundings- May 18th, 2024

So as we get older, it's important to know who you're surrounded by. Obviously in life there are no enemies, there's no reason to keep enemies. That only hurts growth. It's important to surround yourself with people who you know really well and who you get along with. In addition, as we get older people's financial situation isn't the best and most people have responsibilities. So now, it's best I stay to myself and lose touch with a lot of people until I find the right fit for me. I can't be with everyone anymore like I used to be as we get older as everyone follows their own vision. The store is live and it is portable to keep a neutral balance everywhere.


Ownership-May 18th, 2024 [Jim Carrey Inspired]

Today I thought to myself, does anyone own anything. The answer is yes in my opinion, people do own things. They own them on paper. If you think deeply about this statement, if they own them on paper, that means there is a controlling party, so technically people really don't own anything and everything is watched. Some do have more power than others. Some are huge. Some are small. So I own UNGUARDED and was appointed. Even though I own UNGUARDED, it's a seat given to me by people who have watched me persevere as a person and have more wealth then me at the moment. So everyone in this world has a reputation to hold, so it's only good news coming ahead in my life.The power I have is holding and retaining UNGUARDED and doing whatever I want on it. When it comes to capital, I have no access but the people appointed me, will most likely take care of that situation. I can drive sales in the USA, drive partnerships, but there will be more control of UNGUARDED by the people who appointed me. I am grateful and the store is live to keep peace and happiness for my community and the USA. The base is now in London, for international investment until further notice.


Building an Organization From Scratch- May 18th, 2024

Trial and error. Try something, fail. Try something, fail. Try something, succeed. Try something, fail. Try something, succeed. Try something, fail. Try something, succeed. Try something, succeed. Try something, succeed. Try something, fail. Try something, succeed. Keep trying and the wins will pile up.


Working a Job While Owning UNGUARDED- May 18th, 2024

At this time I don't work a job. I work for myself. I am blessed and grateful to continue to tell my story. A lot of people will be happy, a lot of people will be sad. At the end of the day this is all I do 24/7. One day at a time, this shall grow and the respect level shall increase.


What To Do If You're From Poverty- May 18th, 2024

Poverty. So if you're from poverty and growing up 5-18. The first thing one must do is go to a public library and stay in school. Stay away from bad environments as much as possible. I advise opening up an LLC and thinking of something you like to pursue. Then from there, learn traits. My honest advice is to scratch the love what you do, pick up a computer learn artificial intelligence or programming. This is the easiest way out the urban communities. Buy a computer. Mac. Go on udemy buy a course [programming] and then learn that, and use linkedin to make friends and apply for jobs and then use that capital to fund your llc.Boring life, but a safe one.


Basketball [Therapy]- May 18th, 2024

So basketball is my therapy. Huge issue though because I can't afford a private gym. It's expensive. Maybe one day I open my own gym and facility and own headquarters. You never know where this can go as a lot of top tier athletes respect me. So here's some financial literacy for people. Since I own UNGUARDED, I can possibly collaborate with someone hence why I said you should always start your own LLC and build it in the last diary. Imagine Nike funds a private gym for me right here in NJ/NY or imagine PIF does. That would be a dream come true. These days, Overtime is recruiting athletes in the parks so this way they can keep them in that loop, as they chose to do the right thing. Me and basketball are done with but not done with yet as it will always be a part of me. We'll see where I can go with my organization.


A Lot of Time on My Hands- May 18th, 2024

Today, I have a lot of time on my hands where I can type out a lot of great information for people to learn from. Although i'm not the biggest yet, I do have some leverage over the ordinary person, so this is great information for people to learn from as i'm experiencing these things in real life. One day at a time, this company UNGUARDED shall take off and i'll be just fine. I want it to be big, but I can easily maintain this business like this.


What Do They Want- May 18th, 2024

I do respect everyone, but these days they don't even let me get a smoothie in peace. It's because times are tough for people and they are in bad positions. I wish I could help but the only way to help is with my diary. You guys take care. Anyhow, I do have a good head on my shoulders and i'm doing the right things but i'm really focused on developing my own life and my status as a person. It is a bit selfish, but I sat here and worked for 4 years and I realized how bright I am compared to a regular person. I've accomplished a lot hence why I own it. I don't want to keep bragging about myself but i can't be pressed about jobs anymore. I'm doing fine, They have to work on pressing the right way. Press the investors peacefully, not me. I do program, I do create content, I do also read and write at 29 and I also created a great business model. Now it's up to others to an extent, because UNGUARDED is slowly growing one day at a time.


As We Get Older- May 18th, 2024

As we get older, it's really important to stay close to family and friends and stay mature about relationships because everything in this world should be handled peacefully. A lot of people these days have kept distance from me. Maybe because it's best for their spirit and best for their lives, but i'll be really honest here, I can't stop living my life for how others feel about me. I'm blessed because my life is settled and i'm able to build my light and progress. Maybe people are jealous. Maybe people don't like me. Maybe they have issues in their life and they need distance. If that's the case, I can't do much for you guys. I'm living a great life and a peaceful life, and I love my family. I can't sacrifice family time over vc money or entrepreneur pressure. It's important to realize in this situation, what are you going to do to make my life easier. If the answer is nothing, then we can maintain friendly distance relationships because I want to progress my life forward but peacefully one day at a time. It seems like no one has anything easier for me at this time, so i'll peacefully sit here and build my life without everyone until I can get myself to the level I want in my life.


Growth- May 19th, 2024

So this is a really tough situation. At the moment, no one is interested in investing in UNGUARDED and there is no deal or meeting taking place. In addition, I have to be respectable to everyone's occupation. Everyone is powerful in their own way. UNGUARDED is meant to be a venture that receives capital funds and/or works with top tier corporates and/or me owning the whole show. This is the way to progress this as a company, rather than have me typing me a diary only. It's going to be hard to get everyone in alignment because everyone wants too much from me. Lets make sure everyone thinks realistically. Realistically, someone is going to put up the funds to fix the issues of this conglomerate because for some reason no one wants to buy anything in the USA. I obviously want it to be a great environment, but when someone puts up funds, corporate rules come into play. Maybe top corporates trust me with capital without equity discussion. This company needs to be used to hire people. Most likely it's going to be suit and tie. I do see some happiness of UNGUARDED hiring/paying for top tier influencers on Youtube, Instagram, Meta, etc... If it was up to me, i'd probably not care about the views, and i'd focus more on who has the most social impact and cares about their content because that's what lasts.


FIFA World Cup 2026 [NJ/NY]- May 19th, 2024

One of my dreams in the near future is to get into FIFA World Cup and get access to film great talent. I wonder how much the tickets are going to cost, but I most likely will be attending the game. At this time, I think Mbappe has the most star power in soccer. He is the most exciting player to watch. Harry Kane is also a unique talent as his game is interesting. I'm more inclined by Mbappe, Messi, Neymar, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, and Messi's game style but Harry Kane is a great soccer player as well. I am more of a basketball guy though. Vini jr and Jude Bellingham are exciting as well. A pattern i've learned in sports is all the talent is starting to get neutralized. Meaning many are starting to be more similar rather than stand out. Especially at the top levels.


My Favorite Basketball Player- May 19th, 2024

Kobe Bean Bryant. Most exciting basketball player to ever watch for me. My favorite time of Kobe Bryant was 05-09, when he didn't have the team to match him, but he was dropping 40-50, 81. I feel like Kobe Bryant's prime was wasted, but luckily since Kobe Bryant is a hard-worker, he was able to adjust really well. It's crazy when I look at my life and this company UNGUARDED, I can relate to how he feels as I don't have the team to match that capability due to my resources. The team thinks they're worth more so i'm stuck on my own going on a crazy run. My life is obviously different then Kobe Bryant's, as I'm trying to build an organization from scratch, but Kobe Bryant is by far my favorite basketball player. Now i'm focused on aligning my organization with people who are the right fit. I do love the Lakers and their organization. Most legendary franchise ever.


Things I Think About- May 19th, 2024

So as I continue to progress, one of the most important thoughts in my life is, how should I orchestrate my life in this situation. So I do own a small business, right here in the USA and my digital base is in London, UK. The idea of a business is to generate sales. I'll be really honest, as an owner, I don't need to generate sales, but I don't have the access to VC funds and/or top tier corporates. I do have some serious power over the regular individual as me the owner is typing this note after a long shower. The idea of a business is to help people not toot my own horn all day and then sell it to you guys, so this tells me that either a. They're not comfortable with me yet and/or b.My business isn't good enough. These are all opinions, who cares I have to continue forward. I lose patience with people a lot. I want to do business with people who can elevate the name UNGUARDED, otherwise I don't really want to meet at this time, because I think I'm more worthy.


Real Estate- May 19th, 2024

The most interesting topic in my life. So at the moment, I live down to earth with my family and save on rent every day. I am truly blessed. In brown culture, because I can only speak for brown people, this is entirely normal. Housing is costly, and no one wants to put a down payment on a house with my credit to put myself in debt. Although housing is essential and owning real estate is important, I'm more focused on closing deals and partnering with people who can evolve UNGUARDED and take care of that problem since I'm the owner. I'm still running UNGUARDED from the house and am continuing to grow my life every day. I'm building my digital real estate. Sometimes, so many are making much more cash than me, but then I realize I can close one deal, and that problem can be resolved.


Main Focus- May 19th, 2024

So at the moment, the main focus is to build UNGUARDED. UNGUARDED is focused on being a mainstream brand/conglomerate, with me as the owner/founder. Then from there, sales are main focus here wherever I go, and then the rest should take care of itself. I am going to keep building and I don't want the focus to be about money. I need to focus more on the conglomerate. UNGUARDED.


TV Rights[Amagi]- May 20th, 2024

So recently I bought UNGUARDED.TV. Something I am truly proud of as this can lead me to my own tv channel. I do distribute content myself at the moment, but there are no funds allocated for UNGUARDED, although i'm financially stable. I am developing relationships with people who can educate me so UNGUARDED can strive into broadcast possibly. So my idea at this time as I am older is to be in all these sectors as an independent. Store, TV, Artificial intelligence, etc... as many sectors as possible and then have someone fill the gaps financially. Things take time, there is no rush on my end because I am more focused on brand development. Amagi can hopefully get UNGUARDED on TV eventually.


Knowledge- May 20th, 2024

Knowledge. Everyone seeks knowledge. One of the most exciting things about knowledge is where you attain it. Always seek knowledge from everyone and try to make as many friends as possible from different cultures, religions, and races. Keep your belief system when it comes to religion, but when it comes to knowledge, never say no to who you want to attain knowledge. Everyone has their perspective; the more people you meet, the better. In-house for health, align yourself with people with the same moral beliefs but always seek knowledge from everyone regarding business. I am Muslim, and I believe that in this time and age, it is essential to let people believe what they believe, do what they want, think how they think, and work on concepts that are scalable to the world. I'll be sincere: I do try to keep my Muslim values with this conglomerate as much as possible, but in this world, I do make exceptions because of circumstances and critical key holders [People in power] as they have more experience there. Although I use UNGUARDED to strive for change, I am not trying to make any radical changes where people should start revolting or causing havoc in countries. That is not the idea. The idea is to strive forward to make the world a better place, and how I do that is with this conglomerate UNGUARDED.


The Power of the World Wide Web- May 20th, 2024

So I am thinking something. I am typing something and now the world wide web can see it. It's absolutely insane what one can accomplish with the world wide web. These things are just fascinating as I continue to progress. The internet gives so much power to the ordinary person like me to showcase their lives. It's a great place to express yourself and build something to continue to grow.


The Basketball Park [Princeton University [Campus], New Jersey]- May 20th, 2024

Today I was spotted at the basketball court. I ran into two people at the park. At first I was skeptical and I came with an energy and acted tough to make sure that I was safe and sound. These days it seems like the energy is everyone is a bit after me due to the fact of my ownership of UNGUARDED. After the workout, I realized something. That energy is only going to scare strangers away. So I realized I should introduce myself to the people at the park. You never know how powerful they are, and who they are. I realized that I need to stay down to earth sometimes. They are human being like I am. We are no different. I might have a bigger role in life, but at the end of the day we are all human.
Programming- May 20th, 2024

So programming. My advice is if anyone has time in their lives pick up a laptop and get to programming nextjs. This is something that can not only help your life, but if you think can change your life. It creates a simpler life with more opportunity. Trust me you'll be able to live a much more free life. My development of UNGUARDED.com is above average. So is my expo react native development. At the moment this is my asset and a live business. Don't worry though I am a great person and I think scalability. If you're a regular person, i'd advise to learn how to program.


Jealousy- May 20th, 2024

This is a natural part of life. Some people wish they were this and wish they were that. It's important to remember that everyone is special and unique in their own way. There's this wise saying that the grass is greener on the other side. This statement is true. Although I get to work on myself everyday and showcase my light, sometimes I wish I was a way bigger figure, but then I remind myself of all the hardworking people who work long hour shifts. This is a natural part of life, and I am jealous of many as well. I wish I was in the NBA and an NBA superstar but at least I do own this big name. I am blessed and I hope to create an aura in my life that makes people less jealous of my growth as an individual. That will happen when I can provide opportunities.


Investment- May 20th, 2024

As the owner of this company at this time everything is bootstrapped right in the USA at this time. As I said before, the USA doesn't make VC investments so it's hard to have rapid growth compared to a regular company. I do expect the investors i'm connected to on Linkedin to solve this issue right here in the USA. I have some big calls lined up where I'll be really honest i'm nervous because they can lead me to investors right in the USA [Friday, May 31st, 2024] to get prepared for broadcast etc...


Adjusting to Pressure- May 20th, 2024

With a big name comes big money. UNGUARDED is a big name. Am I a big name? I guess I am now, so there's a lot of nonsense going on. People tamper with my health, pull scripts left and right, try to act like omg for money. I want the USA and my fellow neighbors to know there is nothing but great things going on in my life. I do appreciate the school offer, but I made everyone more proud. I learned how to program without school. Expect jobs. Let's go.


Hassan- May 20th, 2024

These days things are taking longer than usual but I am blessed. I have a legitimate business in the USA. No joke of a business. I'm really proud of myself. I love tooting my own horn because if i toot my own horn, then this can be really mainstream. Next Virgil Abloh type thing, even bigger. As a kid I looked up to Kobe Bryant and am muslim. I am doing fine during these times. I have to decline meetings and wait for VC investment and for the money to work for me, otherwise i'm fine with the small business I have right in the USA.


Wealth- May 21st, 2024

One of the most interesting topics in the world. The way we're wired in this world most of us are always trying to attain more and more. I take a look in the mirror and realize, that I have attained a decent amount of wealth that can progress every single day without any annoyance. I have to continue to stay on the right path, but as each day goes by it gets harder and harder as there's more pressure from outside sources. I realized that the best way to attain wealth for me is to focus strictly on myself and if there is a collaboration that is worth pursuing then I shall consider working with others. Otherwise it's my show only.


Career Path- May 21st, 2024

When I was a kid, I always wanted to be an NBA Player. Always. Nothing else. Everyone thought I was crazy and hard headed because I was 5'10 skinny. I'm 29 now and i'm better than i've ever been.The reason for that though is because I have less tension in my life and the bright lights don't matter to me because of UNGUARDED. These lights are really bright, and I'm comfortable growing in this light. My advice to kids is to complete school and go corporate and then allocate the money into stocks and bonds. Unless you have a lot of soul like me and the will to fight for your dreams peacefully, then that is what I advise for career path. Obviously with school there might be debt associated with it, but if you stick it through by 40-50, if you spend wisely then one can attain decent wealth and a happy life in the USA.


A Jumpshot- May 21st, 2024

A jumpshot is one of the most beautiful things in this world for a basketball player. It's insane how much control it has over the brain. When shooting a jumpshot, when the jumpshot goes in, the mind gets a high of happiness. What happens when one does that over and over again every single day? The neurons get used to it. The brain gets used to it. It starts to become a chore. At 29, I feel like a robot shooting jumpshots every morning. Hence why so much negativity can come through while playing basketball. I would play pickup basketball, but with me actually being a real basketball player, I have the risk of getting hurt. Basketball for me is wired as something that is necessary for me to do to stay healthy. It's the way I take my stress out on the issues in my life. I hate lifting weights at this point of my life because it reminds me of a prison cell, so I avoid it for now. Once I have my own private place/headquarters, then from there i'll enjoy serious workouts.


Competition- May 21st, 2024

Competition is needed in our lives, but one should limit competition. This is the reason why people do wrong things. As I progress, I must create a more neutral atmosphere. Since I operate this and this is a small business, it's tough as I continue to build my life. At this point, It's time to create an atmosphere with the investors I'm connected to on Linkedin and to grow my life continuously. Competition is great, but there's no reason to compete so hard in life where it is a threat to people's safety. I'm fine where I am at, one day at a time.


Podcast- May 22nd, 2024

Long day today, so basically I started a podcast. I'll have more information on it soon.


The Bug- May 23rd, 2024

So, while I was recording my podcast today, there was a bug flying around the basement. I decided to bring a fly swatter to kill the bug and went downstairs. I decided to start recording my podcast anyway. While I was recording, I said in the podcast that I was Muslim. As soon as I said that, I saw the bug come down and sit on the couch. It looked like the bug was submitting to me, one of the weirdest things I’ve ever seen. I mentioned Allah, and out of nowhere, this bug comes and stops flying. It’s things like that that make me realize that Islam is real and god is real and/or whatever you believe in. One of the weirdest/most spiritual moments of my life thus far. I did end up killing the bug. These stories are important to write about because it shows that god does exist. Even if you don’t believe, it does make the mind think about how we got here and why things are the way they are.


More Information on the Podcast- May 24th, 2024

So, these days, everyone is on the go and at work. This kills my soul every day because I wish my family were off of work and working for me, to be honest. I realized, though, that I can make my people proud by starting a podcast, and they can listen to me and watch while I’m at work so they have something to look forward to unless they have ideas they want to execute and pursue. So, every day, expect a podcast from me and hopefully you guys watch and listen to what I have to say and the advice I give the youth. This is censored, and I’m discussing topics you want your kid to listen to. Hope you enjoy.


Mecca- May 25th, 2024

So I’ll be sincere. I’ve traveled to many places worldwide and will hopefully travel to more locations. I have to admit Mecca is the most beautiful place in the world. The way it makes you feel is wild. It feels like when everyone is doing Umrah, part of the soul is leaving, but then you realize it’s all an illusion. I miss praying there and miss the peace and comfort I had with Muslims there. That feeling is unmatchable. Maybe one day I have my own real estate there, which would be difficult, but you never know. Dependent on Muslim laws, things of that nature. By far my favorite place in the world, if you're there now make dua for me, as that power is more powerful than money.


London Guests- May 25th, 2024

So I just had a few guests come over from London. They are great people. One of my dad's old relatives from a while back. It was great to see them and see their perspective. I accidentally almost crashed my program while being with them. This new update with NextJS 15 wasn't a good one as a lot of dependencies didn't keep up. 13-14 was totally fine. The update to Vercel was causing issues due to packages being outdated and there were too many to count. I do respect NextJS and Vercel, but they can't scare so many people like that. Hopefully that transition from 14-15 is easy like 13-14. So i'll maintain this and look for people to build around me first. Then hopefully they scale the company.


Direction- May 25th, 2024

So direction of UNGUARDED. Really simple. My show and showcasing what i've accomplished. Then from there, once my name is built and small things around me are built, I have to think about what can be built that's scalable and helps people for UNGUARDED. So look at the situation above. My NextJS program just crashed. A lot of people who support me were nervous as I have no team. Luckily, I fixed it in less than an hour. Now I have to update the website and the app to get these new changes in to adjust as corporate is fast paced. If people want compensation off of UNGUARDED, people are going to have to abide to my vision, so this way there is actually a company being built.Just like how my program crashed, what happens if the concept I make doesn't work? This would be the fall back if i'm built the right way.Once real capital is involved it's all about scalability and getting to IPO or a sale. You get the idea.


My Patience-May 26th, 2024

The good news. I am only 29. I'll be really honest, I wish I accomplished more than I have thus far. I'm still in building stage and a lot of my family is stuck trying to provide for themselves as I keep becoming bigger and bigger. As each day goes by, everyone around me becomes older and older, so it's really important that UNGUARDED gets built the way I envision. I can't take the burden of the people around me on my shoulders, instead I have to see how can I elevate them later on in my life. Also feelings change as people always want freedom and their lives to grow, so it's one of those situations, i'm hoping in a dream world that UNGUARDED becomes huge.


Pressure- May 26th, 2024

I can feel the pressure coming in about UNGUARDED as I progress. The difference between now and the past is that I handle pressure better now. Pressure is all an illusion. The one way to deal with the pressure is to remember that at the end of the day, we're all going to die and pass away. So if I remember that we're all going to die, then pressure doesn't matter. That doesn't mean go do whatever you want in this world and don't care about the natural world and how things are. It means adjust to what the world is, and then see where you can make your impact in the world, but remember this world is temporary and our spirits/legacies will live on, but we won't. Compared to many, I have a lot so I am grateful that I have my own voice, but in the mainstream I have ages to go. This computer has helped a lot, without this computer, i wouldn't be able to express my voice dreams and opinions.


BeReal- May 26th, 2024

So I tried to make a BeReal post today on my old basketball court. It was a roulette day, so it didn't work out as the roulette wasn't the best. I wish it went through, but the moral of the story is to make the best out of every situation. Now I'm writing a diary about it. One day at a time.


Annoyance- May 26th, 2024

I have to deploy patience today. This video is taking so long to export. One of the videos just exported and it took 2 hours. The video for some reason got blocked off. Now I have to sit here for another 2 hours and deploy patience and hopefully the video goes through. Think about how much time and effort it takes to build a brand. From the outside looking in, it looks really easy, but this requires a ton of patience and ton of years of hard work and dedication. Maybe one day i'll have a camera man who shoots content for me while I have a few editors churning out the content. Then from there, once my small brand is successful, big offers can come through. I do understand great things take time, but as each day goes by, I lose a day of me enjoying my life. We'll continue to build aka me, and then from there hopefully go corporate.


Family- May 27th, 2024

My family and I caught a throw up bug today, but we're fine as we are all fine and stable. Today was another tough and resilient day. Love to all and I hope my progress can hopefully help others.


Mindset- May 28th, 2024

So today I caught a fever which sucks. These things are out of my hand but each day counts and I must make the most of it. Today I went to play basketball which was awesome. I have spent so much time playing basketball in my life, so it’s important I document the good things in my life and showcase who I really am as a person. It’s about helping communities and helping people get inspired. Obviously I’m not the most known person but the potential is endless. It’s so weird because it feels like I’m 14-18 all over again except I’m 29. I’m hoping me documenting my story and passion and focus can lead me to places I can only imagine.


Dedication- May 29th, 2024

It's easy to be dedicated with a reward and compensation. It isn't easy to be dedicated when things aren't going your way. A person's real character shows when things are not going their way. I'm proud to say I exceeded my expectations at 29, and I look forward to continuing to do so. The funny part about this situation is that things are not going my way, but I realized this is all perception. If I tell my mind things are going my way, they are going my way. I saw through the perception that although I didn't have the cash for it, I built a NextJS and Expo React Native application that set an excellent foundation and base for my company. In addition, I am creating content and writing this diary that is setting more of a foundation. Rather than focus on the bad, I was able to focus on things that could improve my well-being rather than focus on the negativity that wouldn't help me strive. There are so many things the mind can achieve when it focuses on things that can help people strive. I need to keep an upbeat mindset and strive, regardless of the situation others are dealing with. Some people will be happy and some sad, but I cannot let their energy dictate where my life will go. If it's a situation where some of my family and friends disagree, they will have to deal with it because I said so. Although they are supportive, I have to improve my life. If I improve my life, I can start improving others from there. I don't like complainers and people who think money returns immediately because nothing great is built when focused on a money return. Big things are built when we explicitly concentrate on theories. For example, if my video is getting 10k views, rather than focus on the revenue, think about the theory. 10k more people know who I am. I must build one day at a time because then, eventually, that 10k can become 1M, then a partnership, then a raise, etc... Great things.


JP Morgan- May 30th, 2024

So yesterday JP Morgan [VC investment] gave me a response. Insane to me, thinking about how I started. These days so many energies around me, I have to keep my mind right.


NIL Rule Changes- May 30th, 2024

So with NIL rule changes, athletes want to get compensated for being on a media platform. Being a former athlete and being apart of the culture, all I can do at this time is shed a light on top tier athletes in the community. That's the most I can do, but then I realized ... what about my light. If I focus on myself as an owner, build my name and build my legacy, maybe then I can elevate others and let them build their own. Some have a problem with working for others and want to own their own things, some have a problem with wanting to get compensated, so I realized i'm better off focusing on my life and my intelligence rather than others because others might want to build their own lives and empires. I can't control other people's minds and lives, I can share my life on this platform and let people use it as education to improve theirs. As far as me going to top tier communities to film athlete's, i'd rather take the approach of paying an athlete and their content creator when the time is right. You won't see me filming top tier athletes again. I'll be building UNGUARDED with my name, and then going from there slowly as there's no rush to scale on my end. Things take time.


Been a While-June 2nd, 2024

Tough three days. Been focused on my podcast and making sure I talk about concepts that can actually help people. We'll see where this thing goes.


Mood- June 3rd, 2024

So today I woke up cranky because things are taking a long time.


Improvement- June 4th, 2024

These days I'm so busy that i'm not really able to think as much, everything is on the go. Life moves so fast and everyone has their own responsibilities. I have to continue to focus on building my life and build up who I am. I have to remember there are so many people in this world. Billions of people in this world. I have to be grateful and remind myself that I am in the top 10 percentile of the world.


Growth- June 5th, 2024

The future of this company is going to be focused on things that are out of my control. At the moment, I'm focused on building a lateral company w/ my legacy and what I've accomplished during this conglomerate chase, but it's time to focus on things that are scalable and can provide jobs. The sectors I like are sports, music, entertainment, and most important tech. This is what keeps me motivated as I continue to build my life out.


Chances of Creating a Brand With an Athlete- June 6th, 2024

So I own UNGUARDED at the moment in the states. I do have the authority to sign a top tier athlete. Imagine signing the next Michael Jordan from home and creating a brand. For now, I am telling my story exclusively on UNGUARDED as the owner. The possibilities are endless so it's important to remember that this is a must keep in my life, no matter what. Basketball is my love, sports is my love, and I hope that I can take this brand to the promise land. Don't forget all the people I know in sports.A lot of people. This will workout.


Crazy Pressure- June 7th, 2024

Okay, I have to admit the pressure is building. What will I do next to advance my life? I have many things to improve and even though I am an above average person, I cannot do everything in this world by myself because I am a human. These things are really hard to deal with alone, but I will continue to build the business because my problems can be fixed with capital or revenue. I'm proud of myself because my show on Snapchat passed 20,000 views in less than a month, so I know my name will be attached to UNGUARDED. Although I'm having success, the things I need in this world cost money. I need a user authentication, I need a better store integration, I want to continue to build out Artificial Intelligence and I need to complete my app. These things, I am going to have to build one day at a time, but remember the time spent over the capital injection is not worth it. I'll spend years on an artificial intelligence project that many can make, but I'll look up and I'll see a bunch of conglomerates with millions of employees lapping around with the capital they have injected. That's why I took the strategy to develop my name only and build myself up, so I can be in the same category as these conglomerates. I want people to be on the same page, but people have a million things to do. I realized that it would be better for me to get a deal directly instead of having millions of people in my life. I like to take things slow and steady because I can move forward in life day by day. You will see this written a lot in my book, but it is powerful because to build something, things require repetition. So now I'm a bit nervous because there are a lot of things I want to learn, but I'm going to have to work on my podcast, diary, and work on my app and an artificial intelligence app. Sometimes I want to wait on this, but the more I know in this field the better.


Keeping in Touch-June 8th, 2024

It's crazy to think now that I am 29 years of age. I still remember when I was 13-15 chasing my NBA dream. So much has changed since then. It's really important for me to remember that things don't stay the same. People change and circumstances change. It's not middle school or high school anymore; many have gone on to focus on their own lives and passions. During my life, I'll be really honest, I've been so busy that I forgot about all these people and forgot to maintain relationships with them. I was so engulfed in basketball that I forgot to just stay in touch. Also, I have to remember that kids are wired to think about making it in life and not making it in life. When I was a kid, I thought that having a max contract was making it in life. I still think that, but I realized that there are other ways to create stability in life besides a max contract. I have made my life much easier by just showcasing who I am and focusing on my growth as an individual. Although I do have a far way to go, I am proud of the progress I've made thus far. If I continue, by the age of 35, I'll be in places I only dreamed of. This is a great time for me to try to regroup with people I know from my HS/College past and just see what they're up to, and to see what progress they have made in their own lives. Or maybe at this point, I should keep moving forward and not look back as many are dealing with problems as well.


My Prediction for the Cricket Match [Pakistan vs. India]- June 9th, 2024

So I won't be attending the cricket game tomorrow due to me trying to see how I can evolve UNGUARDED. I am from Pakistan so I will be rooting for Pakistan. It is insane how the USA won against Canada and Pakistan. For my eye, a bit too early to say the USA has the same legacy in cricket as Pakistan and India. Also, just because I am rooting for Pakistan, doesn't mean there will be Indian hate. I do respect India and to be honest I think they are really bright and intelligent. I have a strange feeling that Pakistan will bounce back and win this game against India and then progress.


Basketball- June 10th, 2024

I have about 3-5 years playing basketball the way I want. During this time, I am going to try to work on my game the best way possible and document my skillset. Money is important in this world and so is VC money, but imagine if I made the money through revenue. One of my videos went viral with 18k views on spotlight. Hopefully I get 1M Views and continue to develop UNGUARDED right here in the USA.


How Being Lazy Leads You Nowhere- June 11th, 2024

Being lazy gets you nowhere in life. Some may be born in privilege which makes life easier, but he/she is still going to have to develop things to continue that privilege, because as time goes by, new things are created that are more enticing in this world. If one puts effort, even if it's 5 minutes a day in any craft, if he/she looks up a year later, one might learn something totally new that is exciting and compelling. In this world, nothing is guaranteed and there are so many talented and great people in this world. Rather than think how big I am, how small I am, I have to think how can I use my knowledge to build something to help humanity, rather than hurt humanity. If it's 50k views or if it's 100,000,000 views, if my intention is right people will start supporting and good things can happen and that is achieveable. If I fall in a slump, which happens all the time, then all can be lost to someone who is way more hungry and ambitious. Rather than try to be Mr. perfect and wait for someone to grow the situation, I'm going to have to water my own plants meaning I'm going to have to continue to grow myself.


Investment/Apologies- June 14th, 2024

So I had a podcast recently that may have came off the wrong way. I said that people are taking too long for investment. First off, no one owes me anything. At this time, I am focused on building my own life in the USA as UNGUARDED as my brand. I am focused on showcasing my knowledge and my own talents. I am always willing to adjust for whatever circumstance that may come with UNGUARDED when it comes to growth. I do believe things take time, but since I am always in kid mode these days, I sometimes forget the possibilities of growth. Everything must be done the right way, and everything must be done with rules and regulations being followed.Follow my journey as I continue to build this brand that I own right here in the USA and build out my vision from a toddler in the USA to what my thoughts are now and what I have learned. Thank you.


Social Media- June 15th, 2024

Obviously there is more to life then social media and views, but I'm going to be really honest, the amount of attention that is there these days on the phone is absolutely insane. Recently I was able to obtain 100,000 views plus on all my platforms showcasing my life, which is a dream come true. I am not the most selfish person in the world, but at this time I am going to have to stay tight because I see daylight for this company and UNGUARDED.


Eid- June 16th, 2024

So today is Eid. I look back at my life thus far and I am proud of how far I have came as an entrepreneur. I'm taking a lot of things for granted at the moment, that ten years ago I would be excited about.This doesn't mean that I am not excited about it, it's more that i'm focused on real life and actually building this brand. From my perspective, I still have a while to go and a lot of things to take care of. I'm really happy though that my snapchat is going well and it's driving traffic. I hope that I can get to 10,000,000 views sooner rather than later so this way my dream vision comes true. A while to go but if I keep at it, then the possibilities are endless.


Busy Day- June 16th, 2024

Busy day today as I have so much to take care of while I progress my life. One of the most important things i've learned in my life is to keep a simple life, even if it means there is no hype. The hype can be bought, the hype can be fabricated, the hype doesn't matter. What matters is the consistency. The hype can come anytime.


Progression- June 17th, 2024

I realized something really important today. People are always focused on their own lives in the USA. Everyone wants to build their own life and have their own freedom to do whatever they want. So if I can grab someone's attention for even 5-10 seconds, then from there I take their attention away from themselves. It's important when I grab someone's attention and take someone's time away from them, I make sure that their time is not wasted. At the moment, from my digital research, besides overleveraged assets, all attention is short form. So my main attention goes there for now as I continue to build UNGUARDED as a brand/conglomerate. Eventually, I'll be able to use someone else's attention but from the athlete/artist's perspective, that's going to cost, especially if I want great talent. But if it costs then the value of the athlete and artist drops because they need to be compensated and don't want to work for free, which is totally understandable as everyone has their own family to feed. So the focus becomes revenue to VC, or VC right away so people can get hired.


Great Day- June 18th, 2024

I dunked the ball today. It was a great day. Always awesome to feel like a kid. Tomorrow hopefully will be even better. Can't take little things for granted in life. I also launched a thobe/shalwar. Grateful.


A Universal Banking System- June 19th, 2024

Everyday, millions of people make a financial transaction using their phones. Recently, I made a transaction to Pakistan for my own thobe/shalwar which I launched again yesterday. Today, I realized, why not use UNGUARDED for a Universal Bank? Imagine having one currency worldwide? Something that can impact millions of lives. It would give our world a second chance to get out of the financial system which is built off collateral on top of collateral. This is something we should really consider. I just pitched this idea to PIF/Sequoia Capital using my Linkedin, which I own. I also went to MIT Cryptocurrency Online, MITxPro and programmed this website myself, why not use this IP and brand to create something legendary? Stay tuned.


A Universal Banking System Pt. 2- June 20th, 2024

What do I envision here? The first thing I see is the same IP i'm using. The program would be built using Meta and MIT Open Source Code. I see one currency in the world, worldwide. A blockchain currency. That currency name would be UNGUARDED. I am a US citizen and muslim, so the first place I went to for this unique concept is the Saudi Arabia Kingdom as maybe they have the power to invest into me. I see the USA as the base for it, as the United States is the most diverse place, who knows maybe the USA and I work on this together. A great concept here. Something we should consider doing.


Rule of thumb- June 20th, 2024

Never take anyone lightly in this world. Always respect everyone.


Staying Sharp-June 21st, 2024

When money gets involved, a lot of things change. At the moment, I would love if UNGUARDED could be taken to the next level as I do own it at this time. I am a bit disappointed in how long this has taken to get situated as I am not an expensive guy. I live by my means as I know that money changes everything as it controls our thoughts and mind. I do own a lot of assets thanks to support from my family, but I'd love if me, UNGUARDED, can generate revenue instead of take an advance. Also consider, these times are not the best times in the world, so it's important for me to keep my head down and focus strictly on my goals and life.


What Life Can Be- June 25th, 2024

Been a while since i've wrote a diary. I want to make sure that I write things that can be help of people, rather than things that waste people's time. I realized something really important today. In life, people have their own ambitions and their own goals. So in life, it's important to stay focused on your own goals and ambitions. Many might be happy for you, many might be sad for you, but at the end of the day, life keeps moving forward and it's a must to stay resilient no matter what the outcome is in life. It's good to look back and it's good to keep track of the good things from your past and the bad, but the idea is to continue to build every single day and keep that mindset. I do wish I had more power in my life to help others, but at the moment I don't. So I have to take this attitude every day, stay mentally tough and continue to grow.


Trademark[USA]- June 26th, 2024

So I have so much on my plate these days and a lot to figure out. I had to cancel my doctor's appointment because I'm working on getting UNGUARDED trademarked right here in the USA. At the moment, I am marketing myself and showcasing who I am as a talent, but by 35 this can be top tier athletes that I am showcasing with millions of products and a bunch of people hired. This comes first in my life as I have to make sure that this business is set first before i move forward. Sorry for any inconvenience.


Momentum- June 27th, 2024

Life is all about momentum. Think about the game of basketball. A team is down 10-20 points, and out of nowhere, the team that is down scores. Then from there the other team doesn't score, then the team that is down scores again. The other team doesn't score, then the team that is down scores again and the momentum completely shifts. The crowd starts chanting and senses that the other team might win. This gives the team who is down more confidence and out of nowhere, the team who was down 20 points is now on top winning. That is how life works as well. People start out and don't have the crowd on their side. Out of nowhere, things start picking up and momentum shifts drastically. The moral of this story is to keep pushing forward whether you're down 20-30 points, or up 50-60, because you can be the team that is up or the team that is down, but if you focus on improving each day, the momentum will shift for the better.


Trip to Jersey City- June 28th, 2024

So my trip to Jersey City was absolutely crazy. I had a lot of weird thoughts popping out my head and now that I'm building my own brand in the USA, it's only getting tougher and tougher as things are becoming more difficult to maintain. People are always pressing me for jobs and VC investment and not letting me live, so it's getting really annoying. I wasn't able to get the shots I wanted to, but at least I went sight seeing. The view there is beautiful, so it was awesome that I was able to capture a bereal moment. Logistically, it doesn't make sense for me to go there to film, so I reverted out plus security is uptight about it. The fun part of my trip was how beautiful the view was. The drive back was scary as more things pop out as i'm basically making history every time i write on this IP and deliver content, as I am still independent. Crazy day thus far.


Futbol[Soccer]- June 29th, 2024

I am trying out a new sport, Futbol. I look back and wish I played this sport earlier because I'm not that tall and since i'm pretty fast and agile, I could've probably made it. I do plan to take UNGUARDED into all different sports, so why not start with me. This sport is no joke, as it takes a bunch of endurance and I have to respect the sport. Maybe one day this is a bunch of top tier athlete's on UNGUARDED instead of me.


The Power of Music- June 30th, 2024

The power of music. Music can control how we all feel. Me looking at myself at the moment. I am listening to a symbolic instrument. This instrumental makes me feel like I am a super hero and I am about to take over the world and puts me in a fighting type of spirit.If I shut off the music, and open the door, the reality is there is a bird chirping, the sun is out, and nothing is really going on. This is called illusion. If you study religion, since I am muslim, it states anything that alters the mind is considered forbidden, due to the fact that it can control your emotions. Musical instruments are considered not forbidden, but it depends what direction in life it takes you. I like to keep a balance and think more mainstream but it is interesting to think about. This instrumental is controlling my emotions and putting me in a trance. So now that I'm older and more mature, I realized that whenever I make content, I should put people in a trance in the right direction. That is the way I should live my life.


Building Brand Loyalty- July 1st, 2024

Building brand loyalty is essential. How does one build brand loyalty? Standing for something and being bold and brave. When someone stands for something and is bold and brave, then people can stand with that person, and create a sense of trust and a sense of unity. The idea of a brand is to make people feel like this is going to be a company that cares about people and their employees. At the end of the day the idea of a company is to deliver jobs and to help people and make people comfortable while having them enjoy their lives. Don't forget people give their hard earned time to companies every single day and without people, these companies can't strive. Uplifting spirit. If a brand makes people feel a sense of hope, then that company can generate recognition in the long term, and sector into things that can make people strive for better in their lives. As the one who owns this company, and strives to build my life everyday, I can't forget that the idea of a company is to help others grow as well. I am working on that aspect as we speak.


The Study of Myself- July 2nd, 2024

I realized when I look at my old self I used to always get nervous. As I’ve distanced myself from society, I realized something really important. How nothing really matters. What matters in this life is trying to be the best version of yourself. At 12-15 I would care much more how people perceived me. As I got older I realized that the perception of me that someone has doesn’t matter. I do care about society’s opinion and do have my tough opinions, but my care of failing has decreased dramatically.My trajectory hasn’t been the same as others, and doesn’t fall in society norms, but luckily since I was able to maintain a good relationship with the world and develop my life, I was able to find a way to develop a company and my life without the need for excessive money. Now that I’m able to see with this perspective, I’m able to realize money is a tool. Luckily it’s because my family has gave me that leverage to see life from that perspective. I can now see through things and find that balance with myself and with society and feel comfortable. Now I know I’m the main light internationally but it’s only a light. I’m still at home with my family seeing what else I can create myself without money as the resource. Can I drive this money in? Can I get people to believe in me. This takes time and trust but the first thing people needed to see was me believing in myself and letting go of everyone. 10M views one video and now I have revenue. 5,000 sales a month now I can sit back and scale. I have the luxury to build so I’ll continue to build. It won’t be as big as I want but the idea but one day it can be.


The Soul Snatch- July 2nd, 2024

Let’s take a look at my life at the moment. I’m 29. I own a few assets living with my family. UNGUARDED. This is really all I have. My main focus is to create a conglomerate as big as possible. How can I get there? First and foremost focusing on development from a bootstrapped perspective and trying to build as much as possible myself to help others see a clear vision. The more I do things myself the more experience I'll have handling capital. Easier to orchestrate capital, and easier to orchestrate a successful business organization. The people I ask capital from have all attended Ivy League and all are really educated, so the combination of my bootstrapped education in sports and technology and their expertise with whatever they studied can create a better systematic life for people in the future. Also think of it this way, since I haven't raised money, if my name with UNGUARDED can drive sales, that adds even more value.The more I build, the more they see, the more chances of people working for UNGUARDED and me leading the way with venture expertise. Maybe I close a partnership myself, you never know.


The Journey- July 3rd, 2024

My grandfather used to always tell me one day at a time. That is still something that sticks in my head every single day especially in the fast pace society where we live in today, where our brains are wired to move fast. My family and I have the luxury to take our time, and that's something I deeply value. If I take my time with what I want to accomplish, I'll be in a way better spot mentally then if I rush into things in my life. Overall, I have accomplished a lot in my life thus far, but I can accomplish more. It is really important though, that I maintain this journey safely and take my good old time as I do care about people.


Days- July 4th, 2024

Things are taking longer than usual, so I have to hold my composure. At this point, I know great things will happen for me if I continue to focus on staying consistent. If I don't stay consistent, then no one will look out for me. In my opinion, that's the way it is millions of people are born in the world, millions of people die in the world, so each day it's important for me to remain consistent and hold my composure. The process is getting really annoying, so I have to start working on things that I enjoy rather than hate. Sometimes I wish I had more capital to work with, but rather than wish, I guess I'll have to work for it.


Energy- July 6th, 2024

Ok so another day to chase my dream. I can never take a day for granted. Prolonging things is never the way to go because it can cause controversy that is not necessary. When things take a long time it can drive one’s character to the wrong direction, and then the wrong direction can become habitual and then from there it can become something that turns for the worse forever. Now that I’m mature, I realized these things that I got told as kid are completely true. There are millions of people in the world, and if one goes the wrong direction, they’ll be stuck for good due to the fact that people have to keep tabs and develop humans as well. No one wants to develop a person who is headed the wrong direction because that puts their family at risk as well. So it’s important to lead my life in the right direction especially after all the people I’ve met in my life. That will keep everyone uplifted rather than their spirit down.


Moving Forward- July 7th, 2024

In life slowing down when it comes to venture business is never an option. One must progress and one must realize that when it is time to move forward, it's time to move forward. Unless it's really a serious issue when it comes to business, these days I can't be concerned about local community things. That's a guarantee. Things take time when it comes to venture and big time corporations. I must progress forward.


UNGUARDED- July 7th, 2024

At the moment, UNGUARDED is not where I want it to be. I have so much work to do to keep it pushing forward. Rather than be in I could've done this that and the third it's important for me to use every single day as a day to grow more. I'd love for this conglomerate to be in the VC space, so I'm going to have to build everyday whether it's small or big. I do love Sports, I do love tech, I do love creating content as well, so it's really important that I continue to develop my own life as much as possible and ignore people's feelings as things change as we get older.


Nervous- July 7th, 2024

Nervous about people getting comfortable. In life, you can never get comfortable. Everyday there is someone or something new created in life. People who get comfortable, always fall. These days people are getting really comfortable, so now I'm overdue. A lot is falling on my plate, so I have to get the capital to fix that issue, or find people who would love to work for me so this conglomerate can be built. My advice, always try to stay on top of things.


The flight to Saudi- July 7th, 2024

So recently, I went to Saudi Arabia. That flight was one of the most crazy flights that I've been on. When I was landing, my eye looked outside and I saw a thunder strike. I swore the plane was going down and it was really a rough landing. In addition, when i went on the plane, I had a really crazy vision of a helicopter crash and fire. This moment made me realize that something was way off and I have to stay mentally tough as I keep building this brand and building UNGUARDED. These small moments are insane. I am grateful for people who take the time to script my life and script art of my life. it really is an honor. I plan to payback all these people with a Venture Raise and/or revenue. I always have to focus on revenue, and anyone who supports me needs to be wired that way as that can help elevate us into a better stratosphere with less issues. Again I do consider VC and overleverage.Also the computer at the moment, has this lock, so it's important to keep tabs on my organization as I keep building. Yesterday it broke open for a bit which scared heck out of me, so it's important to lock this asset with me right in the USA.


Update- July 8th, 2024

So I am still right at home in the USA and I am building every single day. I do feel healthy and I am happy as my Snapchat is going well.


What Is There To Lose?- July 10, 2024

Ok so there’s a lot to think about. The first thing to think about is time. In life time is limited,so it’s really important not to waste days. If something important needs to happen it needs to happen sooner rather than later because on earth we don’t have much time. Also when things take extra time, nothing good ever happens. I do believe my family and I are fine, but I expect UNGUARDED to be bigger and have more resources. For now, I’ll continue to build my name on it and keep building the assets as much as possible. I wonder where else I can use my time, but it seems like anything I do, isn’t helping much at this time. Compared to the regular individual it is a blessing that I can make my name bigger than the usual person, but I always want to continue growth so more people can prosper. What happens with less anyway?


My Facebook Went Out-July 11th, 2024

Yesterday, I went to start filming clips for UNGUARDED as I will be starting cricket and demonstrating my skillset in that sport. There were a few talented cricketers who were there playing and I decided to watch rather than go home to think about things and life and where UNGUARDED can go one day. I realized that it's going to be tough to scale content with top tier cricketers due to many reasons. First thing first, most likely these cricketers would want payment if I asked for exclusive clips. In addition, I have never met these families and people before in my life, so approaching them wouldn't be the best as they want to be really good cricketers and I would ruin there workout.I also realized, my facebook will be back, but it's crazy how so much of our lives are orchestrated on social media.Without social media, we wouldn't be able to connect as easy. Who know's maybe I work on developing my own social media platform for communication and fun because that's what people want. Going to have to brainstorm here, but the good thing is I do know how to program. My real concept is developing one universal currency [crypto], but this has so many government regulations that I have to work on closing investment.I do have a few prototypes of how an NFT marketplace would work.


The Earthquake [During Ramadan]- July 11th, 2024

Please no recaps. So during ramadan, I decided that it was important for my mental health to work on my spirituality so I went to every taraweeh. I was at peace, but there were so many pulls from so many directions, that I wasn't even able to concentrate on my prayers. It's really important to realize that in life the direction we go even if we're in a small town can really add up to something outstanding. At the end of the day, we're all important in our own way and everyone brings something to the table. Rather than stay selfish, I know there's so much more I can bring to the table so its always best to unify, especially the way our world works, then separate from each other.


The Way I Feel- July 12th, 2024

Since it's raining today i'm really upset because now I can't make my sport videos. It's days like this I wish I had a gym so this way I can produce content day in and day out or if I had a venture partnership so this way I can produce content of other athletes. Obviously I have to control my anger, but each day is of the essence. In my opinion, I see VC potential for myself and I don't see job potential at this point, as UNGUARDED continues to grow. Unless the job is for a fortune 500 company, I probably will pass because I do think UNGUARDED can be a fortune 500 company. Lets say Amazon, Google, Netflix offer me a job, I can learn a lot from that experience and then I can use it to build UNGUARDED as a fortune 500 company one day. At the moment, I am a one man show so I still have to stay patient and continue to grow my life. With all these things going on, it's really important to think about the happy side of things.


Breaking Down UNGUARDED- July 13th, 2024

If you take a look at UNGUARDED, I do everything myself at this time, due to the passion I have of taking this company and the people who support me to the next level. I do expect a headquarters, I do expect me to develop something that can change things in our future. Let's take a look at what I do every single day. At this time July 13th, 2024 at 5:50AM, I am typing my own diary. From here, I'll be going to play cricket where I film myself and create content. If you look at these two activities, I can break this into jobs. I can have a writer, typing a diary for UNGUARDED.I can have an athlete getting ready for each sport who is top tier. I can have a content creator for each athlete who can create content. Then I can have an editor for each athlete. At the moment, this huge organization is constructed by me, so now I have to start letting go possibly, so the legacy of my life and UNGUARDED can be remembered for the right reasons.


Time To Let Go- July 14th, 2024

So I love UNGUARDED, but it's time for me to relax a bit more and think how this can help others. I'll still be working continuously, but with such a scalable name, I'm going to have to think about how this can help a lot of people, rather than think small.


The Study of People-July 15th, 2024

So if you look at people. People love themselves. Anything that helps people build their own concept, is something that makes them interested as from everyone’s perspective everyone wants independence and wants to build their families life. If I can think of a concept that builds their lives, then VCs would be highly interested. Maybe I can collaborate with someone who has this idea and use this name for global scalability. Things we always need in life. Email. Cell Phone. Social Media. Food. Water. If I can license these things with this name, it can get me really far. For now with resources I have, I can build a small brand which is already live, but then think about the scalability that can be attained with what’s going. If I continue to progress maybe I can develop a master conglomerate from the house that later helps people.


My Mindset-July 16th, 2024

These days it’s like my brain doesn’t want to take a break. It’s like I just want to keep going and going, and there’s no sight of stopping. That’s life. I remember when I used to watch Kobe Bryant videos he/she used to say you have to enjoy the journey or process. As I get older, I realize all of this is really a delusion. I think about building the biggest company in the world, to keep my spirit high, but my resources are dirt resources. Maybe one day I have those resources but at the moment I am grateful to have these resources considering where my family and I came from. So now everyday I feel like it’s really important that I try my best to leave something important for my family. It’s all a delusion, when we go to a huge arena, who owns the huge arena, not one person, it takes millions of people to own a huge arena. So let’s say one person does own all of that, eventually it becomes something that is the regular. I think to avoid this delusion what’s really important is remembering it’s about leaving a positive legacy for the people around you small or big. At the moment I’m leaving a small legacy but better than nothing.


Owning Something- July 17th, 2024

Owning something is extremely overrated. It takes away time from enjoying the little things. Every single day when I own something I have to make sure it’s properly running. Then from there I have to make sure the people around me feel mentally stable. Owning something is awfully annoying, hence why it’s important to share ownership and that’s where my decision has been held. At the moment, I own alone. So I’m stuck doing everything alone, but from my perspective I would love if I had resources to enjoy my life and share this small companies ownership. You live and learn these things and these are things for sure I am going to educate my kid about. Yeah one might have shares, yeah one might be wealthier, but at the end we end up at the same spot. The graveyard and/or gone.


Slow and Steady- July 17th, 2024

So this company is moving at a great pace. I am blessed that I get to showcase my life on UNGUARDED every single day and grateful for the people who follow my journey, but now it's about how can I use myself to help them.Can I use my journey to entice people to make this way bigger than me? I have no idea if that will be possible, as I don't want to sell pipe dreams, but what I can promise is that I'll be able to build my life in a positive light and continue to progress my brand forward and do the right things. I am happy but I want to continue to grow.


Never Take Things Lightly- July 18th, 2024

There's something I realized mighty important about life. Never rub things in people's face. It's good to enjoy but unless really in the drivers seat, always try to remain humble especially due to the rules of karma. Karma exists in every single monotheist religion there is. One day you can be on top of the world, the next day you can be down and out and everything you worked for is lost and gone. At the moment in my life, I do love the freedom I have and do love the power I have to tell my story freely everyday, but then I think about how many more people I can impact in a better way. My family is still working so I have a lot more to achieve, but hey at least I do own this and am working on getting things done properly. Life is about comfort, not money.


What Is Success?- July 19th, 2024

So in life when you're trying to accomplish things people take note of that. People don't like people who make them feel insecure. It's natural instinct. I'm not speaking about myself here, i'm speaking from the outside in. Since mostly in life, people are stuck, they have a tendency to do extra things to follow their direction. In life, unless given a clear direction, many don't know what to do with their lives so they have a tendency to follow people who do have a sense of direction without anyone. My advise to those people is to always think about what you love and always think about what you can leave behind big or small.


Crazy Notice- July 19th, 2024

First and foremost, I am thankful that things are fine and my health is fine. I don't want to relive these moments so please read carefully, maybe think about them not relive them. So I was inside my car, and out of nowhere it felt like a current took off on the right side of my head and all my lights and process went out. Then I read the news the next day which was today and I saw that all planes were cut off and traffic lights were cut off. That was insane to me. A crazy moment. Apart of me thinks that my company UNGUARDED can be huge. It's well on it's way, I wonder if people even read this and if people are going to see the potential in me as a huge entrepreneur. For now back to the house like usual and me sitting here with my family typing this right at the house like a kid in middle school.


What To Do This Weekend- July 20th, 2024

I'm starting to hate the weekends. The weekends are the worst because when people get off of work, their energies are so strong, that it becomes hard for me to continue moving forward. Don't get me wrong I do love the fact that people are off of work and have a smile on their face, but their energies are so strong, that it gets difficult to maintain growth schedule. I'm just starting out so it's important for me to continue growing every single day.


Thoughts of Hiring- July 21st, 2024

Ok so it's 4:59am. I am awake and I am alive. So I just had a conversation with myself about what I can do to enhance my life. Now take a look at what's I'm doing. So basically at the moment, everything is owned and handled by me to start off. This is exactly how many start-ups start. At the moment, I'm typing this diary myself. The average salary for a writer is $68,000. So let's say I put one educated writer on staff. NextJS salary is $150,000 a year. So let's say I hire 5 because that's the amount I would probably need to even get started on a nice system base. Then let's take a look at a content creator, the average salary $73,000, which I would probably need 5 of. At this point I need a $1,000,000 advance to run this business properly. Then also, there needs to be a return as well. It's something to take note of and something to be on top of as I progress. So now, my value is about $1,0000,000 a year if we add up all the jobs I do.


Random Thoughts- July 21st, 2024

In life, you live and you learn. Luckily at 29, I realized how blessed I really am. But with the blessings of Allah and the blessings of all the umrah's i've completed and iA more life ahead, I realized that I have to let a lot of things go that damage my soul.I need to maintain the best version of myself everyday. I can't take these blessings and let them get to my head. Think about the richest people in the world who have wealth. They can easily replace me and use a totally new person and have the same thing built with their wealth. If I continue and run and get annoying enough, maybe I can be of some use to the world. So now that I do have these blessings, I have to make sure that I use them wisely. I am humble, but I'm still in start-up phase in the USA so I have to go really hard. I'm blessed to be who I am, so now I can't save the world, but what I can do is try to make a conglomerate and see who wants to work with me and make this vision come true. What I think we should do is use everything I can about me for a company, and try to help people and influence people.


Waking Up on the Wrong Side of bed- July 22nd, 2024

Has anyone ever felt the energies of others around them? Sometimes it feels like that I'm going the opposite way of others or people's energy is slowing me down. I realized the way to keep my life going is by staying sharp and remaining distant from others. A great example of this, is when I try to maintain my schedule. One minute break becomes a two minute break, then it becomes a ten minute break and then it becomes a 1 hour break. As we get older, everyone has their own dream in life. Some dreams are small some are big but the people you surround yourself with to chase your dream is highly important. I need people who feel the way I feel around me because that will keep me going going going rather than slow slow slow. I respect everyone though because everyone's life is different and everyone's success is different.


Thinking About Things- July 23rd, 2024

So today I was thinking about my past. Who I am as a person and my character. Overall I would say I’m an ehh person. Not the best guy but not a bad guy either. As each day goes by I become a better person. Then I look at my circumstances and how young I am and realize that I have a lot to look forward to and a lot to live for and a lot of talent. I’m way harder on myself then I was before so now I like to focus on who I am now rather than before. That’s life, to be honest I don’t have many regrets because if I sit in regrets then I won’t be able to progress. Also thinking about my potential and where my life can go is another reason why I don't care as much. I like who I am now and am going to continue to progress my life forward. Also I watched this crazy music video for Donald Glover, I'll be honest not my type of music whatsoever, but the art work was genius if you open up your mind and think outside of the box. Now I look to progress stay healthy and focus on building my life.

Now I look to progress stay healthy and focus on building my life. In This Tale Analysis | Disclaimer [I am fine now] When I was at St. Joseph Metuchen, I had broke my nose. It was one of the craziest situations ever. I was out for 10-20 minutes. Then from there, out of nowhere, I woke up fast. It was like nothing happened, then I found out my nose was broken. Allah/God kept me alive for a reason and healthy for a reason. Now I own UNGUARDED.com and am slowly building my own conglomerate.


Scratch Everything- July 24th, 2024

So looking from an outside perspective, what would I actually do with UNGUARDED. The first thing I would work on is programming. Getting developers to build a system that has user authentication/2fa and better store integration and artificial intelligence. Something that is simple, clean, efficient and appealing. So rather than pay someone at the moment, since I own it, I have to go on tutorials to learn this as much as possible myself. Secondly, I would pay content creators to spice the company up as much as possible. If I can get content creators who are more talented than I, then I can develop a brand that can help others and can flourish. Also, I would pay for SEO to get fixed and make sure that the company is seen on google. There’s so much I would do if I had these resources so rather than complain, I realized in these past 4 years that rather than complain inch towards the progress and stay grateful for everything .


My Interests- July 25th, 2024

In life, it's really important to keep yourself tight and to keep your interests with you wherever you go. At the moment, my interests are business, technology, film production, sports, music, and journalism. That might be too much i'm interested in, but for one person, I've done a great job and I've been able to showcase a template as well as display it on UNGUARDED. Now the hope is can this company sector into Venture Territory? I think so and I have to keep an upbeat attitude.


IDK- July 26th, 2024

There's not really much to think about for me these days. I realized i'm stuck in the same loop and the only way I can evolve my life is by working on myself everyday and continuing to try to stay down to earth. I wish I had more time to program artificial intelligence, but now I have to type this diary, create some content for social as most of the attention is there, then I have to complete a podcast. By the the time I get to artificial intelligence, my energy is low and I have no interest. I like my brand and I like my company at the moment, but I know it can be extra ordinary if I keep going and the people who support me join the ride.


My Beautiful Quote That I Just Made - July 27th,2024

In order to be great you have to do what you hate- Salman Hassan


Issues- July 27th, 2024

In life we all have issues. For example, at the moment, I need to go get a car wash for my car but there are so many other things to do that I won't be able to get a car wash. Another example is my Snapchat spotlight is not working, so now I have to fix snapchat as well. In life there are always issues. My best advice to anyone dealing with an issue is to make sure that you try to focus on the good things. Also, always focus on yourself, rather than focus on what others have going as in life you can't control what is happening for others in their life, but you can control what's going on in your life.


The Mind- July 28th, 2024

The mind is so powerful. It gives us the ability to think and come to conclusions. The beauty of the mind is that it likes to give you thoughts that are outside of what you're doing. For example, say the idea is I need to write this diary, the mind will give you alternatives due to your environment and due to the way you feel. Unless something that is critical, it's important to make a sound decision in what you're going to pursue and ignore your mind when it gives you these alternative thoughts. Always keep your belief system tight and continue to believe in yourself.


Thoughts About My Life- July 29th, 2024

I am proud to be a small business owner in the USA and am proud of what I've accomplished thus far. If I continue slow and steady towards the right path, then my life and my company will flourish. Great things take time.


Being a Business Owner- July 29th, 2024

With being a business owner comes a lot of perks. I am way too blessed sometimes. Beyond grateful, wish I can celebrate it but life is always on the go and no one has the time. So I try to keep working and not get too excited about my accomplishments. I have a while to go but I'm glad I do have something set in my life.


Me Staying To the Side- July 29th, 2024

So I'm already tired of the fact that I have to be on camera and I'm tired that I have to continue to build this thing myself. I am truly grateful for what I have, but in life it's always about growing. I have a few concepts in my mind that would work amazing and would make this company more scaleable. If I put myself to the side, and then from there work with the talent that loves me that would be amazing. I would love if top tier level talent came to the house, but everyone is so busy with their lives and career, it's important I build myself and then from there collaborate with others. Once I collaborate with others, I shall put myself to the side and then from there grow even more.


Thinking about VC's- July 30th, 2024

I have a tendency to overthink things and I realized that if I just focus on what I need and continue to pursue, these things can happen. I want to make an artificial intelligence app, so I have to remind my brain to make an artificial intelligence app. I want to make a mobile app, so I have to tell my brain to make a mobile app.


Woke Up- July 31st, 2024

Today, I woke up to Quran. There's something about the way it's rectified that makes you feel at ease. I wish I did understand arabic, but luckily I was blessed enough to have the time to read the quran in english. I hope to be the best muslim I can be in this world, yet maintain a balance in the 21st century- Salman Hassan


Unexpected Things- August 1st, 2024

So in life, always be prepared for unexpected things as things never go the way things are planned. Always prepare for the worst situations, so just in case the worst happens, financially and emotionally one is prepared.Obviously freak of nature things, don't prepare for, but day to day activities and maintenance, always prepare for. As a kid I wish I knew how much of a delusion life really is. Life is all about maintaining peace and maintaining a slow pace everyday. The main saying is, life is a marathon not a race. My family and I love taking things slow hence why our lives become easier. Blessed and hope someone can learn something from this.


Blessed- August 2nd, 2024

So today, I woke up to some great news. I got a great connection on Linkedin from Meta. This company I highly respect as it's outstanding how many great technologies they have invented. The best technology in my opinion, React, which I am using as we speak. So many top tier companies use React and I do recommend that we all use this technology because if you look at the cream of the crop companies, they are all in the same space. As a kid, I always tried to be cool and I would always use Instagram to get the attention of all my friends. One of the best social media companies ever. Hopefully I get UNGUARDED on Instagram which would be awesome this way I can complete this small brand and then move on with my life into other ventures or more growth. My family also came back from Lake George, so i'm happy to have them back with me right at the house.


American Dream Mall- August 2nd, 2024

American Dream Mall was a lot of fun today. Learned a lot about how much people like me and am continuing to learn. At the end of the day we learn from each other. I'll have images up here of my family and I later. Have to stay mentally tough.


Building Strength- August 3rd, 2024

Every single day, I have to build strength and I have to build within myself. So many changes in life and so many people here and so many people doing their own thing, a lot of emotions change. I have elevated my life, thank allah. In life there is always hardship, but it's important to maintain smoothness and calmness, because if you do that you can achieve anything in this world. Getting close, to achieving my dreams and achieving what I wanted in life. I hope to get UNGUARDED on Meta, Tiktok, X, and Twitch. These assets would help me progress my life easier, and build the brand I need.


Patience- August 3rd,2024

I have to stay calm and I have to continue to progress my life and I also have to remain calm. iA more life and more success for my family and I. I appreciate who supports me and I do support back. Let's see what I can do in the field of tech while maintaining this company UNGUARDED.


Thinking the Right Way- August 4th, 2024

Something that gets overlooked, especially as we get older, is thinking the right way. A lot of things happen in our lives where our opinions start to change, and the people we hang around starts to change as well. It's important as we get older, to always try to keep the kid near you. If you can keep the kid in yourself as you continue to progress, you can stay true to yourself. Staying true to yourself, is the most important thing one can do especially as we get older, because people have a tendency to start changing. Maintain who you are as a kid no matter what because that is where you find your true self.


Fixing Up SEO- August 5th, 2024

So yesterday, I was finally able to get the sitemap.xml going. Big step in making sure that there is a stable IP on the internet, and also I was able to add a robots.txt file to the internet. I'm excited to build this brand/company. I wonder if there is any hype behind this company, or if i'm in my own imaginary bubble thinking the world revolves around me. Most likely, I'm in my own imaginary world, but I would love to live in that especially these days where so many crazy things happen. It's important I focus specifically on building out my life using this brand UNGUARDED everyday to continue to evolve my life.


New Trend- August 6th, 2024

The new trend I see coming about is techno. Techno is something that I see becoming really trendy. Old school tokyo drift. More of a hip-hop/techno vibe. Looking from the outside in, I think this market will take off. Anyhow, I don't know what this has to do with anything but it's always good to make predictions and always good to know what people like and what people don't like. Always stay on top of trends and have an overall sense of what people enjoy in life and what they don't enjoy in life. What might not seem as an important diary might be the most important diary that I am typing with my own hands. It shows that I have the ability to see our future. Also get ready for human robots driving cop cars and so forth.


Starting Out- August 7th, 2024

When I had covid, I learned a valuable lesson. Unless you bring value, a lot of people stop caring about who you are as a person. 4 years ago, I wasn't bringing any value. Now the value i'm brining isn't the biggest value in the world, but it is some sort of value. Although this isn't up to my real standards, one has to start somewhere and has to make the most of their resources. At this time for UNGUARDED, there is no team and I have myself so I guess you can say this is my resume. The best thing I've accomplished thus far is learning how to program, so I suggest everyone learn how to program because it gives you a whole another perspective in life. All the times I had as a kid, and all the times I spent with myself can now be read on this diary.


Direction In Life- August 8th, 2024

In life, you always have to stay true to your vision or your path. Whether your dream is big or small, the mind is so powerful and the actions you take in life are so powerful. In addition, in life you can't look back. You always have to think what can I do next to progress things. Always take small actions in life to strive forward and to make sure you're headed in the right path in life. Now that I got some of my life back to normal, I got to see the real situation in my life. I realized that I have to bring the talent and the brains and everyone else has to bring the resources in order for this to go the way I want. I also have to do some soul searching on where I stand in life and what I stand for as a person, because a brand/company is only built based off the soul. My soul these days is so focused on UNGUARDED UNGUARDED UNGUARDED, I forgot who I am as a person. That's what happens in adult hood, so now I have to do some soul searching and see who I am.


Milestones [30,000 words]- August 8th, 2024

So after this diary, I will pass 30,000 words. I have officially wrote a novella that is on the internet. It's an accomplishment in life, that many look over but to me its the start to my real journey in life. This novella is hand written by me and are my true thoughts of life every single day. How I feel is what I express, so I hope when people have the time and are inspired enough they read it. I will be proofreading this later on, but with all that i've accomplished in such little time, this is more than enough for people to understand where my life is and where my mind is these days. In the near future, I hope to maybe turn this into journalism about what's going on in the world and articles possibly.


Thinking Outside the Box- August 9th, 2024

These days, it's really important to think outside the box especially with what is going on in our world, every single day. There's war going on in our face, there's rapid advancements in our world left and right, so it's important to not get caught up in all these things, and to look at life from your circumstance and see how you can help. Whatever situation it may be, it's highly important to think from your perspective realistically and see how you can help. That's what I strive to do everyday. I know a lot of things in life are uncontrollable, so I like to focus on things that I can control.


Growth- August 9th, 2024

It's been a while since i've visited Pakistan. I still remember eating Pizza Hut, I still remember all the great times with my family playing soccer and scoring 8 goals. Pakistan has became way more modern then before, they're even playing football there. While I try to get UNGUARDED together, it's important I align my life where my family grew up and so this way I can align myself for my health as I focus on a capital raise for UNGUARDED being an owner. Proud to see apart of my heritage in the USA and the growth of Pakistan.


Update- August 9th, 2024

So now I have realized something. It's always really important to stay down to earth. My whole life doesn't revolve around UNGUARDED. It's a blessing to have this platform be mine and even write these words, but there's much more I can do then UNGUARDED. My store is live and I am telling my story. I wonder if I'll land other opportunities, maybe brand deals and brand collaborations. It's been difficult, because people want a capital raise, but hey at least I can start by telling my story.


Building a Brand- August 10th, 2024

As each day goes by, an opportunity is lost to do something great and leave something behind. Sure we all want easier lives and easier times, but it's important to work specifically on a goal to attain something. Whether it's a small thing or a big thing. I think I can classify UNGUARDED as a brand, minus the hiccups. A bit disappointed in the growth of UNGUARDED, but there is a lot of scalable potential here, that can't be ignored. I am working on it every single day so this way my life is better.


Restaurant Scalability- August 10th, 2024

So now I have to think about the name UNGUARDED. It's an amazing name, there's a high chance of this being a global scalable name, so it's important for me to stay humble and stay peaceful and stay down the earth. There are so many talented people here, right here in my community that have similar visions of what I want to achieve. So for a while, I had to be really selfish because as I said earlier, a lot of people have the same dream as me at heart. So I remain humble and I want to see if this possible. I have a while to go but a lot of the internet stuff I have taken care of and am working on TM's. One day at a time my grandfather told me, and honestly there is no rush because in life everyone has a family and has families to feed. So i give everyone I can the freedom to do what they want in life. I am humble and grateful for what I have achieved thus far, but I see a lot of potential.


The Main Focus- August 11th, 2024

I have to focus specifically on my career these days. So much nonsense going on these days, it's important to do things fair and honestly. So when I dropped out of Rutgers, I started UNGUARDED myself and then invited a few of my old colleagues. Due to people wanting to start/purse other ventures, I decided to take UNGUARDED solo and partner with more colleagues who can provide more value. Then from there, same situation.Luckily for me nothing was actually under UNGUARDED, and my family and I for 4 years finally went official and reset without anyone due to so many circumstance. I'm happy that things are going the right way for once and now that I have my own company in control, I can start doing things the old school way and more professionally. A lot of content I made of top tier players myself so luckily so my life is set right here in the USA.


The Topic of Love- August 12th, 2024

I don’t know if I have love in my heart. These days, I always feel like I'm trying to chase more and am really greedy. When I look back in high school, even college, and my life now, I have a high tendency leaving people behind over money and/or doing things to get attention. I think it’s because I came from poverty to an extent and compared to really wealthy folks who are well established I didn’t have much, but these last 5 years I have changed my life way around and realized money doesn’t matter. It’s the only only thing that matters in life, or is it? Actually, the only thing that really matters is providing for your family. So, think of that statement and put money aside and see how one can provide for families. Always think around money. I still don’t know what and why I was thinking as a kid, but then I realize how crazy life really is and how far removed I am from these types of situations. It’s hard for me to develop trust levels and it’s only going to get harder, so I thought, how can I be RAWR and MEAN so I can kind of have my life in a safer spot and then heal people emotionally. In business in life, everyone is after their own greatness, so it’s important for me to adapt to these circumstances and be as greedy as possible. I just hope to meet either a. Down to earth big talent that can help me drive sales and keep my authentic self as good as possible and/or b. people who like me for me and support me through my ups and downs and actually want to ride or die. If people were patient enough and realized the farther, I go the more chances of me helping, although I can help now if people put to their pride to the side then from there this can be a huge organization, a lot of nonsense blocking me off, I know my potential and I have accomplished a lot thus far. Also, a lot of bs popping up left and right because I've been around people who are just old and people who just don’t understand where things are. I also don’t condone violence, and I do work peacefully with people.


Adjusting to Circumstance- August 12th, 2024

So these days, people are getting old. it's really important to have civil meetings and do things the right way. The problem is in life everyone has their own visions, so I have to follow mine. My vision is doing the best I can to create a brand that represents myself and my theories, so we'll see where it goes.


Love Life- August 12th, 2024

After a while, I finally realized how easy my life is and how blessed my life is. I have decided that I will have to grow my own life on this IP UNGUARDED and try my best to keep a more peaceful spirit. Sometimes the RAWR in me needs to be there because i'm still an athlete, but I realized it might be time to let go of that RAWR. It's time to realize that i'm 29 years of age and I am blessed to even tell my story on this IP. Blessed. Eventually maybe this will help someone grow their life, but things take time and I want to take my process slow and steady so it causes less havoc in my life


Maintaining Composure- August 13th, 2024

So at heart, I'm a bit upset at what I have accomplished and what I have came up with from the time of age 29. Maybe I can accomplish more alone, but I need more help to accomplish more. Also, woke up from a crazy dream probably and don't even know what happened but whatever. I have to continue to be the best version of myself that I can be and focus on what I can focus on with the resources I have. I do want to invent something but I'll have to focus more and it's going to have some purpose. I'll lay my attention there. KFC invented his recipe at 62. I'm only 29, my potential is endless. I also need to meet better people as well who can help me grow.


Perspectives- August 13th, 2024

Life is all about perspective and it's really important to see from your perspective. Rather than focus on the other person's perspective. Know your roots and know your perspective well so this way you can pass on knowledge to the next person.


The Impact of Community- August 14th, 2024

In this world, who you know is all that matters. The more people you network with, the more the respect level grows. Also to get that respect, you have to accomplish something that has never been done before. We're already there. The idea is to improve communities but have people ever thought about their words. Words are so powerful,but they lead to actions. Although people want to portray their perspective, the words that they use lead to those same actions in their communities. As kids we're all inspired by people's words, so the words they say matter. Everyone goes through it and their environments are rough, but if they can plug away a few people from each place and give time for their art, these communities would be safer.


Thinking About the Days I Used to Film- August 15th, 2024

So I miss those days where I used to film and meet up with top tier athletes. So many great times. Although I didn't really know the guys well besides basketball, I felt like my old coach from aau during these times. I tried to be the best mentor I can for these kids and obviously I did get something out of it which was some authentic film. I'll be really honest though, the artwork I have now In my opinion, it is worth way more than what I used to be doing. I learned a lot from those experiences and I got to soak in knowledge from those athletes but little they did they know they got to seek a lot of knowledge from me. I am really blessed but I am proud that I went to meet with top tier athletes and film them. Would I go back and film them again? Maybe a one time situation in the NBA, for the culture, other than that I'd love this company at scale as it's supposed to be. The vision came true.


The Moment I was Stuck in the Water- August 15th, 2024

I still remember when I went Water Jet Skiing. There was this moment, where I was stuck in the water. I was just sitting there and I felt so still, that I couldn't even move the jet ski. Rather than panic, I sat there and realized that since I didn't know how to ride the jetski, I could think about other things. At this time, I don't remember what I was thinking about, but then there was also another moment, where I was in the water and then I tried to go over and the wave almost took me, luckily I got over the wave and my family friends and I got out of the Jetski and got to walking. Crazy Moment.


Education- August 16th, 2024

Always use your education to enhance your life and always use it to enhance your life rather than keep it stagnant. Reputation is key in life and that's why I like to keep mine extra extra sharp every single day. Im really focused on developing more for UNGUARDED and focused more on developing the app. By 35, this should look highly professional and this should be a running company owned by me and shouldn't be me doing all the work.- Hassan


The Magic Number 20- August 17th, 2024

So the 20 note. I have my own special 20 note. It's called the purity 20 note. I had no idea that I had this special 20 note. I have ran into this number so many times. It's a really important number in our world and i still don't know why, especially in corporate. As one advances, one is going to realize how important numbers are. 20,50,100. Any sort of art produced around these numbers gives one an around to generate real heritage wealth. Always produce- Hassan


Pride- August 18th, 2024

In life, pride is never good to have. Make sure to stay down to earth and remember people. Never chase money is my real advice. Always chase comfort.


Grandfather- August 18th, 2024

So my grandfather and I used to be really close. Sadly he has passed and I am still alive, but we share really similar visions and he was my main mentor in life. My grandfather had a cassette tape shop in NYC that he used to run with a lot of amazing disney movies that I still love. He used to always give me a bunch of movies to watch. Now it's crazy because I own UNGUARDED a company that showcases my own content. Luckily for me my grandfather did get to see the happiness of UNGUARDED bought by us and get to see me chasing him the dream, I wish him nothing but the best in heaven[Jannat], and iA when it's my time to return hopefully not anytime soon, we will reconnect.


Maintaining Myself- August 18th, 2024

We're getting old, and I am not where I want to be in life yet. I am getting closer every single day to achieving what I want but there is so much going on these days, that it becomes difficult. Also I have to start thinking about capital flow and/or collaborations as soon as possible with a sense of urgency. If anyone wants to help me provide for my family that would be great, as I've been stuck in maintenance mode for years.


Habits- August 19th, 2024

So habits are really important in life and they always add up. If one decides to keep a bad habit, then the bad habit becomes something that is habitual. Example, if someone has a habit of cursing consistently, then this habit becomes engrained and that becomes difficult to rewire. In addition, if someone has a great habit such as writing this diary every morning, then this habit can add up and next thing you know, a book is written that can provide knowledge and basic knowledge for someone. Always try to form good habits rather than bad wherever you are in life.


Big Day- August 19th, 2024

So today was a big day for me, as I was just able to wire stripe for UNGUARDED.com and hook it up to my DNS Server. In addition, I was able to go to the USPS and ship a keychain to my aunt that will be sent pretty soon. As I look at USPS, I realized how many small businesses there were and realized how fortunate I am to even have a business. I do hope that one day I can sit here and employ others, but we'll see where my journey goes. For now I am happy that I am an owner and all my hard work paid off. Again not the biggest, but definitely an owner.


Moving Forward- August 21st, 2024

So I have to take this week off to kind of think things through and relax my mind and body so this way my health stays sharp. I don't want to over think things like I used to as a kid, I want to stay the way I am until something is worth my time.I do respect everyone, but I'm blessed and am focused on my life. I do love sports and I do love the people I grew up with, but with the world changing every single day, it's important for me to change my direction as well. My attention will go towards tech development and maintain the sports knowledge and education I have. In fact, how else do you think I'm typing this diary? Due to tech knowledge. Humble and blessed.


Changes- August 21st, 2024

When one puts money to the side, they start to realize what life is really about. A lot has changed in my life. I look back, I was really self centered, although that hasn't changed much, I was just wired crazy to be honest. I look at my old self in disgust all the time, although I wasn't that bad but that isn't an excuse to not be sharp. I have changed for the better and the idea is for me to continue to develop my character as modestly as I can as I progress in life. Issue is all I see is a replication of myself in these kids these days. Now one may ask, what does this have to do with putting money to the side? Well when I look back all I cared about and all I was taught was make sure you make a lot of money. Now I run away from money. If it was up to me, we would be more strict in our education system, and teach them more business and ethics.


Building Templates- August 22nd, 2024

So in order for me to maintain myself as much as possible, I have to template out a bunch of coding templates. These coding templates will help me build out better bases for UNGUARDED and build out what I need to progress my future. From my perspective, the money won't make a difference it's about the people I decide to align myself with, more than the money as I want to build my own legacy for UNGUARDED.


Adjusting- August 22nd, 2024

So in life, it's really important to adjust to what circumstances are in business. Also it's really important to keep peace as much as possible. I am still young as an entrepreneur but my life is definitely headed the right way and the right direction. I do love life slow so this way things are done the right way and less people are affected at a global scale.


Sadness- August 22nd, 2024

In this life, so much happens and so much changes that I've had to change the person I've became. I am trying my best everyday to maintain the kid in me and make sure that I can help others evolve. The way I have my organization running, I realized that this can help others by supplying jobs and by teaching American Education for others. Instead of me writing, maybe it can be others writing about what they like and what they love.


Superhero's- August 23rd, 2024

Today is Kobe Bryant's birthday, when I was a kid, this was by far my favorite super hero. He made basketball look so easy. May he rest easy. The whole world is built off Kobe Bryant. Even Meta took the time to pay homage. All our numbers, our health lines, etc... are built off this wonderful character. I never met Kobe Bryant, but everyday on Youtube, and a few games that I went too, I tried to take the most of his mentality and copy it. These days I'm not as Kobe Wired, or well at least to me I'm not, meaning I'm not working the hardest in the world, but his legacy will live on forever in all of us. Never met him, but learned a lot through the way he presented himself. One can tell though that he was not a shallow character and I try to keep his mamba mentality everyday.

Kindness- August 23rd, 2024

So today I went to the masjid for jummah prayer at my old mosque.It is one of the most beautiful mosque's ever, ISCJ. In my situation, I am blessed to be an owner, the issue now is I hope to help more people. Overleverage and things like that take time so sometimes emotionally it hurts me to see all the people I do like stuck at work or not knowing what to do. There's nothing I can do about it, so I get angry and so do the emotions around me. Luckily for me I have a lot of great relationships so I can continue to progress as a human and keep telling my story so this way people get inspired and continue to grow their lives. I appreciate everyone helping me through this process.


Eating at Badsha- August 23rd, 2024

I went to Al Basha with my family. A lot of people have their eyes on not me but UNGUARDED these days and it's getting really obvious. I am blessed and I can't wait until this thing is off my hands. People these days act like they don't care but at heart, I can feel their energy, all they care about when it comes to me is UNGUARDED, they don't have no care for me. I guess that's how life works. It's always about money these days as I do understand have to pay their bills, but I have to pay mine so I'll have to build around solo dolo, although I do feel upset about it, that's life and that's just how it is.

Using People- August 24th, 2024

So everything is about perspective. Some are going to think I don't have enough style, some are going to think this is amazing, some are going to say it's ok, but at least they have something to say. The one thing about life is, it's opinionated. I've dealt with this problem my whole life. I think there's this saying that you have to be consistent enough where they can't ignore you. So I try to keep consistency and try to consistently produce, because if you produce something, maybe someone will actually like it.

Being Nervous-August 24th, 2024

Adjusting to circumstances is something i've gotten used too. These days, it's important I continue to be ready for adjustments because that's the only way growth happens. That's something I'll have to do every single day. I also have to get ready for others to take over by 30 and I'm excited for that growth or maybe I continue myself. I only see good things happening for my future and my families for future.


Craziness- August 24th, 2024

So compared to who I was in High School, way more mature and way more accomplished. I have to continue on this path of programming and making sure my organization is really really sharp. That's how you get investment and something done. Not by panicking around things. I obviously am not crazy, but I do see this going venture raise and I do see this going top tier potential with all the people who have put time and effort into this. Luckily it's in my hands and my journey continues for a long time. My advice to avoid the craziness is to stay away from energy that might be harming and always know your surroundings. Really important.


All New- August 25th, 2024

These days I think about my life and realize how much nonsense has happened. Hopefully as I continue my life, less nonsense continues and more growth continues in my life and more growth takes place. This is only going to happen alone, hence why I work so hard, otherwise to be honest nothing would be happening whatsoever. So it's really really important to stay out of the way of my life and my business otherwise things can go the wrong way. It's important to always try to do things the right way, but in this world it takes time as one little thing, turns into another thing, then another and can get out of control, from a world perspective.


Exhausted/TM- August 26th, 2024

So the way my life is, people quietly celebrate my victories. So my TM has been applied for. Ten to be exact, and I am truly blessed. These should definitely go through and now I can think about how eventually rather than my history of building a company from scratch, thinking about how I can sector into others. I do respect everyone and I do care for others, hence why I even put my own money capital up for it. For the greater good of society and the growth of my life.


Baby Steps- August 26th, 2024

Companies are being built left and right, but I'm happy as this company is building real heritage and can have a real future right here in the USA and then eventually grow globally. This is exactly how it starts, and then from there, things become bigger and bigger. I also love the name, so I'm proud of how far I've came as an entrepreneur. I do have a lot more to accomplish but since I am building every single day, I can see all my hard work pay off in front of my face. 10 years of making content, 10 years of research, and 3-4 years of coding, have got me to this point. So now I have to see how this business can be on hyperdrive without me so something greater can be developed.


Another Accomplishment- August 27th, 2024

Yesterday, I developed my own Palestine Fund to stop help stop the war and project my voice. I realized that my voice can make a difference and that I do have one of the biggest voices in the world if not the biggest. Although I am muslim, I don't promote violence both ways meaning I don't support violence of innocent Israeli kids dying either. That is the truth. These days people are wired crazy so what I'm saying is going over there head. I haven't been to Palestine yet, so I don't really know the situation and who's winning etc... but it would be a blessing if the war stopped. 4 Subscriptions today need way more. - Hassan


Palestine Donation- August 27th, 2024

So today I got my first 5 subscribers which i'm proud of. At the moment, I'm stuck waking up my corporate friends and showing them the issues that are going on overseas and how grateful we are to have these opportunities. Again I have nothing against Jewish people and don't support wars, but I am hoping that we can create an equilibrium in Palestine. I'm always busy with corporate responsibilities for my organization in the USA so this is the most I can do without losing my comfort.


Skipping Out on Hajj- August 28th, 2024

Thanks to my family, I have been able to create this company about myself. Without them, I wouldn't be able to do what I've been able to do. I'll be skipping out on my passport photo for Pakistan. I wish I could come, but at the moment, cash deprived. Luckily, I do have a skillset and I do have the mindset to continue and to build something that can maybe help people. I'll be really honest, I don't know what, but this can be decided with people and I. It's really important that we drive people into direction, so that's what I'm forcing, whether it's with my company or someone else's. A bit upset at the time I'm taking to take it to the next level, but then I think about keeping this and owning it if no one wants to really help.


401k, Roth IRA- August 29th, 2024

So now I'm looking at my life. I don't have much cash, but I do have ownership of UNGUARDED. These last 10 years have been a crazy ride and today I was thinking if I had just took a job how much would I have lost out on. Let's say I have a corporate job at Meta or one of these fortune 500 companies and I'm saving on retirement. The max amount with my degree and trajectory is about $5,000,000 dollars. I do think UNGUARDED is worth more than $5,000,000 dollars. In school's we have to start teaching kids how to start building things and creating their own wealth. I am really a lucky guy, sometimes harsh, but at heart care for people's well being. I expect UNGUARDED to be huge one day.

Soft Thoughts- August 29th, 2024

So in our world and our society, we have to start thinking more about how to help each other and stay calm. We should all respect one another regardless of our beliefs. Trust me you would be really surprised how crazy things are these days, luckily not near the community I live in and near.


Dull and Easy Times [Mecca Nashid]- August 30th, 2024

At this time, i'll be taking slow and steady and safe for now, and will be teaching people how to better their lives as much as possible. UNGUARDED is live, but as far as mainstream, this is going to take some time. I think 2030. I'll have to continue building and doing my best to go the right way. I will be releasing 5,000 videos of short form quick hitting content instead of working now.I think by 35 i'll be comfortable getting married having kids etc because I need more time to heal in my life and need UNGUARDED to be settled.


UNGUARDED [Jummah]- August 30th, 2024

So things are moving really slow these days, and no one is giving clear direction in what to do and where to go. At the moment, taking UNGUARDED really slowly, the money doesn't matter. One day at a time is really important when it comes to building a corporate culture and heritage, so blessed to be able to build this company.


Eating at Sahara [New Brunswick, New Jersey]- August 30th, 2024

So Sahara was a great time. I respect everyone but I am fine with the intermediate family I have. I can't control where and what people do with their lives, so I am grateful to have my same life as a toddler and as a kid to being a grown man. All the experiences of me, shaped me to be who I am so I'll need all of them in one if possible minus the injuries etc... obviously the good things. I do like this new me and I'm getting adjusted to all this. I can't really feel the fame and I can't really feel the energy, I just hope that everyone is doing fine that I remember and the ones who really love me for me and care about my health stay near me. Thank you. As far as UNGUARDED being a conglomerate, I am typing this diary, so grateful, and now I have to see what I can do for myself as in life its about attaining more.


Leaving Things Behind- August 31st, 2024

In life, you can only control what you do and how you progress your life. At this time the way I progressed my life is by programming. It's really important to progress and progress rather than think about the past. I'm really proud of myself as I know how to program websites and apps as well and still kept my artistic talent from all the days I used to film HS/College Basketball games. Now it's time to build an organization. Thanks to the USA, I'm pursuing a TM, so this will help close legit business and progress our world ahead. Thank you.


Always Invest In Education- August 31st, 2024

Education is more powerful than anything in this world. The fact I can type this on the internet and showcase to the whole world is due to education nothing else. Thankful to make it through and blessed. Now I will need programmers to take over my job of programming, content creators of creating content, and thinkers to take over my thinking.


Passing on to the Youth- August 31st, 2024

So basically in life, the first thing someone should do is build their foundation. Something I admit I could've done better when it comes to Islam or whatever religion one is. After that, from there one should learn things that can help build a foundation up. So in this example, one should start learning how to code, then one should learn how to create content, and then should replace me etc. Then one can put someone on W-2 and get them hired so it gives people good hope and less people going crazy. This is mighty important and especially with my ownership of UNGUARDED.It's about peace love positivity with discipline.

Applying for Entrepreneurship Program- August 31st, 2024

So I applied today to see if I can get residence in Saudi Arabia. It's my long life dream to visit inside of the Kabba and to be able to live in Saudi Arabia. Took a while but since I programmed UNGUARDED.com and all sorts of assets this would be the biggest reward. I do expect UNGUARDED to be separated from Islam, but for now UNGUARDED is my showcase of what I have accomplished. It could be that too, but we'll see how people feel about it as relationships matter first.


Creating Consistency- September 1st, 2024

In my crazy imaginary life, I want to make this app, make a robot, make everything alone and then own it and force kids to program under me so I can make my dynasty the way I want. I am living my crazy imaginary life as we speak.So I will have to follow through with the app. I will have to learn all of this and if someone comes in with the amount of capital required, then from there I will let go. I take myself really serious, but not too serious because we're all human. I'll have my dreams come true.


My Meeting with Saudi Arabia- September 1st, 2024

So had a great meeting with Saudi Arabia. I am based in the USA. They all know who I am and I am really happy about it. We have communicated many times and the company UNGUARDED is being built. It might not be as big as people imagine Saudi Arabia to do right away, as we all know that the country that holds Mecca one of the most beautiful holy sights, to me the most beautiful obviously, but it will be a company, so going in the right direction of things in life.


Order in the USA- September 1st, 2024

So today I ordered from a manufacturer to create Sweatshirts and T-Shirts. I am so looking forward to the sweatshirt and t-shirts. Hopefully kids get inspired and buy them and one day i can hire these kids if I make enough. I am really successful, and I am working on apps and content all the time.


Having a Good Motive- September 2nd, 2024

In life, it's important to have a good motive and to keep a stable mindset. If there isn't a motive, then life can become worthless. I am trying my best to use myself to help people stay motivated in pursuing their dreams as many are upset that they even have to get ready to go to work. I'm also hoping I can travel and have more fun experiences in life, but I have to work on myself first.


Strategy- September 2nd, 2024

It's important to have a safe and sound strategy. Jokes aside, strategy is the key in life. Also, never fall in love with anything, it's really important to learn skillsets maintain them so you can use your mind to help change things for the better. So at the moment, I know how to program NextJS and Expo React Native, Create Content, Create Brand Portfolio's, Sports, etc... Blessed by Allah to own UNGUARDED.

Slowing Down- September 3rd, 2024

I am 29 years of age. I'm happy with what I've accomplished, but now it's time to educate and teach others what I have learned and use this as something that can help people out of tougher situations. The first step for me is to make sure that UNGUARDED is wrapped in the mosque in my community as they probably have many wonderful kids there. I expect kids to learn how to program and once they complete that they can work for me possibly. You never know. Basically what i'm saying is it's time to start progressing and time to start to learn traits that can help build society for the better.


Another Day, Another Opportunity- September 4th, 2024

I wonder if I'll be able to take UNGUARDED to that next level. Obviously at the moment, I have a lot going for me, but UNGUARDED in my opinion has a lot of flaws. I have yet to meet with investors for a serious capital raise, high chances that this company becomes a classic NJ/NY brand and I end up owning it and doing a lot myself. I'm a bit upset on how so many people have held out on me during this time, but that's life and hopefully UNGUARDED becomes the conglomerate I want it to become.


Big Victory- September 4th, 2024

I'm so excited about my future ahead. These days a lot of people's energies are off as we get older, but I programmed UNGUARDED.com myself and was able to launch a company off the ground myself. Imagine what I can do with a real team. It would be a a total nightmare. Things taking a bit long due to government clearances, but I'm sure that UNGUARDED will be a huge company and I'll be the founder of it after this accomplishment.


Programming- September 5th, 2024

First and foremost I have to thank allah for being awake today. These days my motivation isn't the highest because I'm getting older and older and my journey is becoming tougher and tougher. Now I have to complete this website and I also have to complete an app myself. This is going to be difficult as I also need less IT maintenance but I definitely think I can get it done. I have to envision myself completing more routes for my website and a user authentication. Then I have to prepare for my app. I know I can do this and I have to stay tough and continue this way for now.


The Future- September 5th, 2024

So in the future, I see me living a long happy life and exciting life. I see people possibly working for me. I also see the muslim religion increasing a lot due to the fact of it's discipline and force of unity. Praying 5 times a day together with people, forces people to be friends. Something I acknowledge in real time is the fact that we don't communicate enough as muslims in the USA together to build our futures. I see that changing dramatically and more muslims being peaceful and wealthier. UNGUARDED is going to be a successful scaled brand that might be out of my control, but high chance that the people I know will run it. I do see myself working on this as well and building it the way I want and people following my peaceful vision to success rather than violence and extremism. I am excited for where things will go.


Staying Home for Jummah- September 6th, 2024

There's a lot of places I can go, there's a lot of people I can meet, but for some reason, these days I don't feel like traveling and don't want to spend. I live like the average 9-5 worker and earn like one, so money doesn't grow on trees here. I'll probably be living like this for a while. I still have a lot to accomplish and I'm just getting started. Maybe I get an exciting partnership for 2025, but I'll be honest, I doubt it as I'm aimed on making my own brand.


Update- September 6th, 2024

I am really proud to have my own organization in the USA. The only thing i'm upset about is the decentralization of my organization and lack of community and helping others. The way I decided to help this issue is really simple. I decided to trademark as much as I can in the USA, while programming UNGUARDED.com and building a brand based around my name. Once this is complete, then from there I can align with people who have capital and/or something to offer to help community and kids. As far as helping kids in the community and documenting athlete's, this isn't the right time until the organization is generating enough revenue. The main goal is everything aligned with me right in the USA, and $2,000-$3,000 revenue in house. Once complete, the chain will be built, and then from there can start injecting capital that actually can help these kids get employed.- Hassan


Money is Not The Motive- September 6th, 2024

So something I would love our people to know in this world is, always live humbly and never chase money. Always work on building things and working with people with resources so others can grow as well and have an easier life and educate themselves.


4:33am- September 7th, 2024

Emotions can run high at this time for me. So since I don't have capital to work with yet, the tension around me is high as people have to take care of their families. I am happy that I do own these assets on paper in the USA, but things take time as far as global scale investment. Luckily another days closer so closer to good things happening.


Changing my life around- September 7th, 2024

So I decided to change my life for the better and go the way I used to call corny in my mind. I realized, that way is the safer way and the more resilient way. Our lives are illusions and my grandfather was always right. One day at a time because unless the opportunity uplifts people, then there is no reason for me to even entertain it.


Growth- September 7th, 2024

So now that i'm older, I need a better situation where i'm more excited and happy. The old school of me is tired of everyone and doesn't feel like doing anything. I'll see where it goes. Also I saw a dead deer today. What a shame and then I saw a leg on the basketball court. Was scary. Don't be alarmed, kids keep playing sports.


A Kid's Story- September 7th, 2024

There was once a bad kid, who wouldn't listen, and the teacher called his mom and he learned his lesson. He started crying and then he started being good forever. That's how life starts for kids. Really simple. Then life becomes more complicated. A lot of people might think why isn't this and that. I'm lucky to have the same kid in me everyday and still continue to focus on my education and dreams.- Hassan


Moving/Leaving- September 8th, 2024

I am getting ready for my voyage to leave to Mecca/Saudi Arabia hopefully. I do love the USA, but i'd be way more at peace if I lived in Saudi this way I can pray namaz at Mecca and Madhina. In the USA, which I do love, it's way too loud and way too annoying these days. It's probably because I lived here for so long. I'll definitely come back though and enjoy my time here as well. It's a spiritual decision for me. So now I'm mentally preparing for that.


Dealing with Ownership- September 8th, 2024

I'm glad that I was able to launch UNGUARDED myself and was able to get this off the ground. Now my main focus is maintaining consistency myself. Once the consistency is built then from there hopefully I can be put to the side but thats how one starts a company. Anyhow I do pray for people's happiness and I do hope all is well for everyone. I respect everyone but I do think things will workout especially if I take it slow and I stay patient with my growth. Like my grandfather said slow and steady wins the race. I do treat everyone with respect but I can't save the world, but who knows maybe one day. I do want to hire so one day I'll hire. I have to keep an uplift vibe and things will work. I want to make this app myself, but I think it's time to network and see how I can collaborate with others.


Waiting on Meta, Tiktok,X, and Twitch [UNGUARDED]- September 8th, 2024

So im proud that I programmed UNGUARDED right here in the USA. Thanks to Saudi Arabia for accepting me in their country and it was a great umrah. Now I own this name and own the assets right with Washington DC and serious safety. Happy to be alive and thankful. Now my main focus is getting capital together and I do think it will happen. Willing to work with people who have experience.


After Discussion with Myself- September 8th, 2024

So after thinking about it, I will focus on aligning my life with the 2030 Vision and hopefully UNGUARDED will follow. I think this is the best fit for the company that I own so this way more people are hired. In the USA, I am focused on generating sales and the company is live. Subscribe now and buy now.


How my Life was Shaped Thus Far- September 9th, 2024

So the way my life was shaped, the max potential if I went to school and got a degree was probably a top tier corporate job. These days although I am bootstrapped, I am thankful to have this company UNGUARDED in my hands and be safe and sound. I wish things were being worked on faster, but things take time due to so many circumstances. At the moment, the main focus of this company is myself and making sure I'm healthy and safe and aligned the right way. The fact that is a problem is concerning, but that's life and we start somewhere. I'll continue on this road and go slow and steady.


Weather Change- September 9th, 2024

So the weather change threw me off. I had a real tough time playing basketball today, but it's really important for me to stay sharp every single day so I'm ready for big meetings. Everything we do is being watched so we have to do the right things and always be aware of that. Also in life things change. People go this way, people go that way. I believe I'm headed the right way.


My View on Society- September 10th, 2024

So when one is born in the USA, the first thing we chase is the American Dream. In America, one has the freedom to think and build his/her own worth. This is the reason why USA culture is so rough tough and gritty at times because it's quick pace and a get your own field. Take a look at wall street. 11-12 hour work shifts and right after lifestyle time and networking time to generate more wealth. The way I live in the USA isn't like that. The way I live in the USA is more like an entrepreneur. For example, I'm typing this diary. In 5-10 years the worth of this is going to be a lot in my opinion, so I continue to build myself using the freedom America gives me. I'm proud to be internationally known and i'm proud to be able to build my own company right here in the USA.So back to society. In the USA, my honest advice is finish school and work a corporate 9-5 and make investments to hopefully build net worth and work on your own thing in a rational manner or develop a run rate that is cheap and then work on building whatever you want to build. Keeping expenses low, living at home, then building out your dream. This keeps one safe in society and this keeps one chasing their dreams. Now at 30, i'll be able to raise capital and take this to the level it needs to go.


Setting a Standard- September 10th, 2024

So the best way to set a standard is by actually getting things done. Today I locked everyone in a new lock, the February 28th and October 6th lock. What's so crazy is next year Ramadan starts on my birthday. Things like this remind me how allah exists and how god does exist as I'll be turning 30 this year and I am close to making my real dream come true.


Needing a New Laptop- September 11th, 2024

So soon, I might need a new laptop maybe in a year or two. At the moment, I'm going to hold out on getting one, because I have to save money. To be honest, I don't know why I'm even running UNGUARDED at this time, so I'll be looking for an overleverage to put myself to the side.


Looking at My Life- September 12th, 2024

So these days my love life is nowhere to be found. I do have plans of getting married, but I'm so focused on my career. I don't think I'll be getting married anytime soon. I do wish I spent that time programming, but now that I caught up on that time, I'm not upset about the time I wasted. When I do get married, I do expect to have a kid and hopefully the kid listens to the scary strict version of me, rather than the kind version of me, so this way they can progress their life. I'll find that balance with my future kid though.


Working on Something That Makes a Difference- September 13th, 2024

At this time, UNGUARDED doesn't have a purpose. At the moment, my company feels soulless. It's not helping people grow their lives. It's just there. I do hope eventually my story can inspire kids to achieve their goals and dreams as I am a regular person and to be honest nothing really freak of nature about me, besides the fact that I'm a crazy hard worker. I am happy that I still own UNGUARDED, but there's much more that can be achieved with this name. Imagine a theme park, imagine making a new car, imagine making a sports arena. Elon Musk didn't make Tesla himself. Elon Musk didn't make Zip-2 himself. These things can happen especially if I drive the right way. With Podcasts, Diaries, Shorts, and consistency of programming online, UNGUARDED can be one of those names.


Visiting my Grandfather- September 13th, 2024

So I visited my grandfather today. He has passed away. Most of my direction in life really came from my grandfather as he was my biggest supporter. I'm glad my grandfather did see UNGUARDED live and get to see me as owner for a bit. I wish he was able to see me married and to have a kid. Now I'm happy because I know my grandfather's spirit is happy. God willing my family in the USA has a long life. Life is going my way and hopefully the direction of my life goes the right way. I am really grateful. Allah has put me in the right direction of life, where everyone else goes is not my responsibility.

Allah, the Eternal Refuge. 3. He neither begets nor is born, 4. Nor is there to Him any equivalent.”


Way Too Much Annoyance- September 14th, 2024

Every single day is work day. There is no such thing as a day off. So now I'm sitting here, thinking about all the advancements that can happen with this name UNGUARDED. So many it's not even funny. As each day goes by, things get more chaotic because people are focused on their own visions that really don't matter. Now I am focused on my own vision and hopefully it comes of use to other people.


My Programming Journey I Will Begin Regardless [Spiritual]- September 14th, 2024

So what I made on this website, went over everyone's head. It's something that is not easy to do and is not easy to maintain as I am using VC technologies and have a beautiful base set up. Due to all of the inconvenience of my journey, I will be charging right here in the USA. 10 Dollars for donation. Products are live. I will not be hiring anyone until revenue is made and/or capital investment and/or good brand deals are brought in that help people survive.


ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ- September 15th, 2024

All praise is for allah, the lord of the worlds. I'm learning arabic every single day and starting to read a bit of quran. I'm hoping by 35 I can read and write arabic and still keep my talent as an entrepreneur, programmer, and above average athlete. So I'll have to be selfish because although I do love maintaining my code, I think it's time that others start maintaining the code and start learning how to program.


My Favorite Sport Teams [USA]- September 15th, 2024

Own UNGUARDED so these are the teams I do love at this time. The Los Angeles Lakers, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Eagles but with football I always dance around. Loved the McNabb and Terrel Owens days. I hope to go to a few games once I get UNGUARDED off the ground. Kobe Bryant, Jeter, McNabb, Owens, etc... My favorite athlete of all time is Kobe Bryant.


Back To Coding- September 16th, 2024

Now that I've built this base, I have to see how I can evolve day by day. I do love being self owned at this time, but the issue is the potential of my growth is limited due to lack of resources. Also, so many are busy with their own passions that they don't have the time to help me build. I'll probably go one day at a time with UNGUARDED until it's a situation where UNGUARDED is mainstream. As far as other dreams, really don't know what else I'll be doing. Sometimes I do wish I can sing and produce music because art is so influential.


More About Me- September 16th, 2024

These days the world is chaotic but I can sense a peace shift. I do hope the world becomes more peaceful and caring for people at heart. Although I do joke around a lot, and mess around a lot, the future generation in our lives will need easier lives not harder lives. Proud of myself thus far in life. Looking for more growth in my life.


Overall News- September 17th, 2024

So I was looking at the news today, and I realized something so important. Our brains are programmed to like aggressive and crazy news. For example, when someone blows something up and/or someone shoots something, our brains as regular people get a kick out of it. As a human, we're always looking for the wow factor. It's so important that we don't lose touch with ourselves because as entrepreneurs and regular people, believe it or not, naturally we get the same wow factor from the bad news as well. Important to keep around people who are sensitive to these things rather than don't care.

Replacing My Items- September 18th, 2024

At the moment, there are many items in my house. I am sitting on a bed. There is a chair in front of me. There is also a backpack and sweatshirt and a camera next to me on my right. Think about all the time someone spent to make these items for us to use. The goal here for UNGUARDED is to make these items possibly one day and/or sell them as well. Replacing the items that are important to me, customizing making my own and then creating a brand.


Programming an Artificial Intelligence Robot- September 19th, 2024

I am proud of myself and proud to announce that I launched my own robot on UNGUARDED.AI. Using OpenAI I was able to integrate a robot model that answers many questions. Thankful that I was able to get this done. The next thing that is left is styling this IP and making sure that it fits the way I want


Nothing Much to Say- September 20th, 2024

Now I'm starting to sound like a robot. I keep repeating myself, and I keep saying the same things I know over and over. It's time for me to acquire some new knowledge that helps my life and helps me progress in my life. Knowledge is way more powerful than money. Not saying you don't need money, but a lot of good things can be accomplished without money.


My First Shipment [USPS]- September 20th, 2024

I have proudly shipped my first shipment in the USA of a sweatshirt. I am beyond grateful and proud. I take these moments for granted. I want my company to keep the child in everyone excited. Many sadly are dying in the soul and I hate to see me being the only one being happy at this time. I am trying my best to see how this can be bigger than I.


Masjid [West Windsor, NJ]- September 20th, 2024

I went to another masjid today to see how it was in the USA. It was a real peaceful and soft experience. Something I realized money doesn't always matter. Now I'm focused on my own journey. I'm making sure my journey is peaceful and my journey helps my family and I. Support me and who knows maybe one day I'll have the power to support others.


The Journey- September 21st,2024

I've been on this spiritual journey now for about ten years. The money does matter but it doesn't always matter. Art is more powerful than money. Influence is more powerful than money. Having a voice is more important than money. Obviously money is one of the most important resources in this world, but the most powerful thing in this world is Network. You're only as strong as your network.


Great Workout- September 21st, 2024

So I just had a great workout today. I'm blessed with what I have but it's really important to align and evolve. I think about Pakistah, Jhelum all the time. A lot of bazar's everywhere. Imagine all of these Bazar's aligned under UNGUARDED to create more unity? Only a thought. Would be a dream come true.


Time is Going- September 22nd, 2024

So time is going by really fast. As each day goes by, I lose a day and so does the rest of the world. What is the purpose of this life? Is it money? Is it family? Is it education? The purpose of this world is to leave your legacy behind while remembering to prepare for the main test in life, the day of judgement. If you notice, muslims are forced to pray 5 times a day because it creates unification and it brings people together. The issue is though, if one prays with people with different missions in life, then it becomes difficult to build yours. So I like to stay to myself, do my own thing. As far as employment for others and things of that nature in the USA, until the company generates enough revenue or capital that will be off the table. Luckily since I do exist, UNGUARDED exists as a company and there is a bright future ahead.


My Education Level- September 22nd, 2024

I am a college dropout, but my education level is one of an Ivy league student. The reason I can say that is because I have real life experience building a brand myself based off my life at 29 and have programming experience using Meta. This itself is an ivy league accomplishment. Now I have to see how I can get the collateral, which is honestly my problem because everything is always overleveraged and people love money as people have to provide for their families. I don't want to do seed rounds, series a rounds, b rounds etc... as this limit my growth, I'd rather go around.

Annoying- September 22nd, 2024

So at the moment, everyone is getting annoying. I have to do what's best for my life. A lot of people are trying to hold my dreams which is really annoying. I have to do what's best for my life, others don't matter whatsoever.


Needing a Break- September 23rd, 2024

In life, it's really important to take a break. At this time, I am really overdue for a break. The time I have spent working on UNGUARDED is catching up with me mentally and spiritually so it's important I get breathing time to be who I am because to be really honest, it's starting to feel like the work I'm putting in doesn't get the reward I want.


Footlocker [American Dream Mall]- September 23rd, 2024

It was a tough tough fight. Authentic Fight. Now I own UNGUARDED and I am proud and thankful. Compared to the corporate situation it was difficult, but now I'm here and enjoying my life. I wish this was scripted, but this wasn't had to fight for it. Proud of myself small or big. I also didn't find my car and I had to press the alarm button in the mall. It was an embarrassing moment but I got what I need to get done, NOW I'M OFFICIAL!!!!!!!!


Consistency- September 24th, 2024

One has to remain consistent to ever make progress in this world. These day's I'm awfully self centered for a reason. The more self centered I am, the more growth for everybody. The less self centered I am, the less growth for everybody. That's how life is. Now I have to wait a few things out for my venture and I do expect everything to go through as I'm back from Covid-19. I do expect budgets and I do expect great things to happen in the future.


Great Workout- September 24th, 2024

Today I felt like myself. I worked out really hard. Now I'm thinking about how I can close a budget and start helping real communities. I don't have VC investment yet, but with a lot of hard work and dedication I was able to code UNGUARDED.


Muslim Alignment [2/28/1995]- September 24th, 2024

My muslim mission of making UNGUARDED will be accomplished iA. I am a peaceful muslim and a really blessed muslim. In 2025, Ramadan will fall on my birthday. I have became a practicing muslim and a much better and mature man. I still have to be a regular human being.


Restaurant- September 24th, 2024

I just went to eat at a restaurant in NJ. It was good food but I can feel the love decreasing day by day in the community. I have to be awfully selfish at this time because UNGUARDED should be it's own Venture rather than something that is owned by me. On February 28th, 2025, Ramadan begins. Maybe I start making a small documentary for when the world turns muslim way as many believe this in Islam or a commercial for merchandise. It would be something really cool.


Surat Al-Baqarah [The Reason I am Muslim]- September 24th, 2024

I am muslim because of verse 2:28. My birthday is on 2/28. I am obviously healthy now and safe and sound. At 15-16, I broke my nose and was unconscious and people thought it was over, but thanks to allah I survived. The verse states "How can you disbelieve in Allah when you were lifeless and He brought you to life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you [back] to life, and then to Him you will be returned." The unseen always has power over us. I am liberal though and do like to enjoy my life like a regular USA guy. Usually when religion comes up, people go way too much. It's important to relax and maintain as much as peace as possible and stay down to earth with people as people are people.


Time for Work- September 25th, 2024

In life things take time. I'm really grateful that I even have a platform. Is there a chance the SEO gets stuck the whole time, maybe, but I think in the future this will get figured out as well, so I'm going to continue my journey of UNGUARDED. All life is about is leaving a legacy behind. This is how I leave mine.


Companies- September 26th, 2024


There are so many companies in the world. Now I have one little company in the world. Luckily for me, this comes with an advantage. My life is documented by top tier talent and my hard work didn't go unnoticed. I'm hoping that I can turn around all of these people to put more people in suit and ties instead of jail cells.


Grateful- September 27th, 2024

First and foremost, I am grateful to be waking up today. iA I have a long life ahead. So I am using a laptop. Imagine we used the name UNGUARDED to invent a new laptop/processor. I am using VS code. Imagine making a new VS code. I am using React. Imagine building a new system to program. I am drinking a preworkout. Imagine me drinking a custom made preworkout. All of these things are possible as humans have accomplished these things. Never be lazied out. Now in my journey I'm looking for people who might want to take UNGUARDED this way because at the moment I do own it and I have found UNGUARDED which is an historic thing. Since I'm one man, I've decided to take the selfish route and document myself until the right fit is found.


Breaking Down a Company- September 28th, 2024

So let's break down a company down to it's core. First and foremost there's the vision of a company. What does the company stand for? Why is it different from all the companies in the world? Truth be told many companies are really similar. Look at Dick's Sporting Goods, then look at Sports Authority. Same business model, yet the distinction of branding helps you create a separation in your mind. The color of the first sports store is green, then the color of the second sports store is red. So now as a human, what is your preference? This is how simple it is to separate your entity from others. In the future I do expect unification and more bankrupt companies due to the fact that human species are smarter and are starting to realize that everything is basically the same. I'll dive in deeper into what else is important in a company, but let this paragraph soak in. That's my opinion.


Tired- September 28th, 2024

I see a lot of potential in myself at this time. I have to continue to build day by day. Money in this situation doesn't matter unless it helps others grow. That's how entrepreneurship actually works. Chains.


How Important Art Is- September 29th, 2024

Art. One of the most influential things in life. It can influence people to make good decisions and/or bad decisions. It can also change moods. Use your ears wisely.


I Can Change the World With My Light- September 30th, 2024

I can change the world with my light. Keep people more sports driven, car driven and away from drinking, smoking and cursing and things they will regret. As we get older, we have to start thinking, what would kids wan't. They would wan't us to build things in the future that are inspiring and they would all want safer situations. That is what I support.


Capital- October 1st, 2024

Capital is something that is absolutely necessary for companies to grow. Is there anything more important then capital in a conglomerate? There is. Drive. Not driving cars, actually maybe driving cars, but alignment. Making sure that people are aligned one way for growth. Having a team, having a army working on one's vision. Nothing great can be accomplished alone.


Make Progress Forward- October 2nd, 2024

Yesterday, I barely made any progress. I made one simple design for my website that I made myself. This design due to so many blockages and annoyances took the whole day. Let's say I progress move forward every single day, then from there when I look back, so much can be accomplished. Always move forward.


A Reward- October 3rd, 2024

I am in my senses completely. I have completed the task of coding UNGUARDED. This is something that is going over everyone's head. Now I need a reward for it. Everything is done for a reward. When a kid goes to college and he completes his degree, his reward is usually a job. So my reward here should obviously exceed a job. If not,then so be, but that's how life usually works. Beyond grateful accomplishing this tough task.


Alone and Safe [USA]- October 3rd, 2024

Crazy Times. Alone and safe at Home Base.


Yesterday's Tech Update- October 4th, 2024

I will see how the app reacts now as I am checking web and mobile. When is Expo going to be web friendly and IOS friendly? Who knows. Expo has a while to go with simplifying App IOS upload and google android upload. At this time, the web doesn’t react well to the upload due to having to adjust to different formats. So since I have to showcase on the web, I’ll have a unique format that is dumbed down for videos. On mobile it works. On web it doesn’t. Once the app is complete. I’ll change the videos and format them. I will also have to check formatting of the mobile app for android as well to make sure that everything is in line. This is not easy whatsoever. I expect VC capital for this company. So from a corporate standpoint I could've worked on the app myself. For some reason people in the communities wanted to block off and thought it was a joke to block me off. Either way the website and the app are now all live.


Driving to See Mosques- October 4th, 2024

I decided to drive and see how my local community masjids are doing today. I don't run the community or anything like that, but I wanted to see how people are doing, how things are aligned and how I can actually help. The only way I can actually help the community is to progress UNGUARDED, otherwise I really have nothing to offer to anyone, just like anyone else. I'm focused on building my own organization, but with building your own organization comes alignment and this is where the issue is. The issue specifically is who is going to put capital funds and fix the SEO. Maybe this thing is blocked off forever. It's time for me to emotionally detach and see how I can make my life simpler while holding/owning the digital keys.


Getting Ready To Work- October 5th, 2024

Since at this time I am an owner, I'm dealing with a lot of issues. The biggest issue being supply chain management. I can't attach my company to random companies in the back that I've never heard of, so it's important that this company UNGUARDED resets and works on who it's going to align with. In addition, I'm trying to change the function location to Paris, France, but for some reason it pings in the USA consistently. I am still a US Citizen. That isn't an issue, but was wondering why it isn't. Vercel came out with this new feature where it pings to the closest server/location. Since I reside in the USA, it's stuck there, but would love some space to fix this international alignment and get this hooked up the proper way. Paris is a great neutral zone for this to be hooked up too in my opinion for international supply chain management.


My Vision- October 5th, 2024

Look at CNN, Look at Washington Post, Look at ESPN, Look at Nike, Look at Chase, Look at all these companies. This is possible to make right from the house. It might not be that, but it is possible. At this time I can't pay employees and I don't have enough revenue, but I do have assets and I do have myself. If I continue and make enough noise and put my pride to the side I can easily make my own organization as well. I'm only 29. I'll continue to develop this website and then I'll make an app then I'll continue to make content, then it will catch traction and then people will be working for me. I am really exhausted but I am not because my mind said I'm not.


My Sister's Birthday- October 6th, 2024

My sister has turned 19 today. I am proud of her and proud of her accomplishments thus far. Now it's time for her to be great. As far as me, I really don't have much to say these days or do. I am learning arabic and learning quran while growing my brand. Once I learn arabic, I'll be satisfied.


It Makes No Difference- October 7th, 2024

It makes no difference what you make, once you become an owner. You can make $1.00, you can make $100,000,000. What matters in life is how you influence people for the better and not the worse.Is what you're making inspiring many? Is what you're doing bringing people to the right direction in life? Is your intent right? What if in this world, there is no money? Then what? What are you doing to inspire and help others grow? Try your best to keep people inspired and keep them upbeat. Sadly in our world we all have to pay the bills, but I'm blessed that I have a comfortable place to live, because trust me compared to others, I really have it good. I hope that inspires others to pick up a computer and focus on their dreams. The way my life is aligned, I won't be able to help communities at the moment, but what I will be able to do is give them hope to create their own.


Legacy- October 8th, 2024

Everyone in life is legacy driven at heart and wants respect. Think of the kid in us. We all have dreams, we all have families, and we all have aspirations. The issue is, it's hard for all of us to have our dreams come true so it's better to dive in for one dream and think grand. The more freedom we all have, the worse it will get as many don't have direction. I want to continue to build my legacy every single day and enjoy my safe life.


Education- October 9th, 2024

Education is so important in this world. It can make or break you. One doesn't have to go to school to be educated, one can honestly use the internet and get educated. I have learned so much using the internet. Without the internet, I would be stuck at a Library going through book after book not learning anything. So now it's important for me to continue to use the internet to get educated and continue to do the right things to improve my life. I want to make my UNGUARDED app more sharp and my website more sharp. Once that is done, then from there I can maybe create something that is investable or something that helps my family prosper.


Pursuing Dreams- October 10th, 2024

So dreams are really important in life and it's important to continue to chase them consistently. Even if it's a small dream, always try to pursue them. Sometimes in life, your dreams don't come true, but dreams can always adjust as life doesn't always stay the same. Rather than put people down, see how you can pick someone else up. I'm happy I can still pursue my entrepreneurial dream every single day. It really is a journey but it's good I continue to chase it. Always pursue your dreams.


Standing Firm- October 10th, 2024

Always stand firm in what you believe in. I know my family and I have a lot of life to live and I have a lot of life to live, so I'll continue to prosper and be great. I'm excited about my future and waiting for things to take off


Writing This Diary- October 11th, 2024

I am not happy these days but I am proud of myself. Obviously, I'm grateful. Obviously I am thankful, but that doesn't mean stop working. I decided to continue to work hard and deploy patience. I'm hoping to find the right fit of people who can take this company to the next level. I want to match the same level of greatness that people have put into me.


Might Launch the App- October 11th, 2024

My main goal is to launch an app on my birthday 2/28/1995. I am beyond excited. Hopefully all goes well here as I continue my journey of UNGUARDED. This would be a great accomplishment.


How Simple Life Is- October 12th, 2024

Let's look at life. At the moment I am using my own brain to type a diary. This diary has a certain worth. It has never been written before. If the author is respected as a writer, it's worth even more. Let's look at the website. The website has it's own certain worth. Since it's never been created before. Life is really that simple. Always look to create things rather than focus on capital. It's that easy. We all have the ability to create something and be something. Always do things with a purpose in life and keep striving.


My Opinion on the USA- October 12th, 2024

I love the USA. The USA gives me freedom and it gives me the ability to do whatever I want. Sometimes I get tired of the USA, but not that tired. It's 1:01pm on a Saturday, and if I want to go overseas to get my mind right, the country would let me as long as I get my visa. I get all the freedom in the world to do whatever I want as long as I do the right thing. Sometimes I do wish the communities worked better together, but other than that one of the most beautiful countries in the world. I am a muslim american, I do wonder where this journey is going, but it's headed the right way. Thinking about past situations, doesn't really help the country and me progress forward, but iA things become even bigger.


Waiting on the Instagram- October 12th, 2024

I'm waiting for UNGUARDED in Instagram right in the USA. I am really excited despite all the outside noise that gets caught inside here. Proud of myself for owning UNGUARDED.com, UNGUARDED D&B Numbers, UNGUARDED on Youtube, Snapchat, Linkedin, and Bereal. It's no big deal whatsoever if I don't get it. I'm proud of myself for coding UNGUARDED.com and my mobile app that will be coming soon.


Keeping a Balance- October 13th, 2024

These days I feel like it's really important for me to keep a balance. Also since I'm in work mode because I want to leave my legacy behind i'm a bit different compared to the regular individual. I tend to have mood swings because things are moving a bit slow, and I'm more NYC wired, which means go go go. Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm sad, sometimes I'm mad. Then I think about how tough people have it and get right to work. Settling down can only happen once things are aligned. Also, I can't have UNGUARDED control my feelings. There needs to be more to me than UNGUARDED. Family and friends isn't really the answer, because at the age of 30-50 people are only wired to focus on their bank account and careers mostly. I like the way I am crazy, then peaceful, then happy, I'm like any other human. At this time, it's been my show. This can change in the future.


Feelings- October 13th, 2024

These days there are so many people doing their own thing, I totally forgot about what I want to accomplish in life. So now, I have to focus on my feelings and how I feel and how I can make life easier. The more life is easier for me the more growth there is in my company. I do hope that everyone I know is doing fine.


Creating a Legacy- October 14th, 2024

Every day, we have the chance to create a legacy. 10 years ago, in life, I had no idea what I wanted to do. Now I'm blessed to have found my direction in life and chase my entrepreneurial dreams. I'm 29 and have my whole life ahead of me so it's important I don't waste a day and continue forward and progress into better situations in my life.


Seeing my Clone- October 14th, 2024

So I was in Princeton, NJ and I was able to witness my clone driving a motorcycle. It was the craziest thing to see, made me lose my mind. I wonder if this clone is going to come and meet me in Princeton today while I play basketball. Absurd.


Making a Podcast- October 15th, 2024

I am making a podcast live for UNGUARDED.


Gym Time- October 16th, 2024

Yesterday, I went to Diesel Gym. It was a great time. A lot of great memories came up in my mind that reminded me of good times. I wish I was able to keep all the people I knew in HS together with this company, but sadly, I'm on my own when it comes to that. Now I have to see where things are headed in my future. I'm old. 29. I am excited to see where my future can go though. I know I have a lot of potential.
Access- October 17th, 2024

Access is everything in life. Meaning that having access is all one needs. It's more important than money. If one has access to things, then from there they can evolve. I have access to this code, so I'm able to create my own framework on the internet thanks to React. These things start adding up, and then from there, I can start getting access to bigger things. Always keep working.


Diesel Gym- October 18th, 2024

I still remember the old days when I used to be at Diesel Gym. Such a crazy environment. It really shows the true environment of bodybuilding and powerlifting. I do miss those times, but these days my style is way more relaxed. I'll be spending some time there for now while I wait to scale UNGUARDED. I need to keep that mindset as I progress with my life because, as we get older, things become tougher and tougher mentally. We all go through pain and suffering, so it's important to ignore it, and hopefully, life becomes better and better.


Continuing to Build- October 19th, 2024

In life things happen and it's important to keep good relationships tight especially as we get older. At this time, I have great relationships with my family who do care about me and I hope to build these same relationships when I go into bigger business. Especially these days, things take time and it's important to stay safe and calm. A lot of things are reckless at the moment for me due to alignment issues and things changing left and right. My life is really safe, but I have to get in and out of places all the time and things are definitely changing.


Focusing on Details- October 20th, 2024

I am grateful. I do care about people, but life is about progression. I'm proud of what I've accomplished thus far. Sometimes I wish I could help more, but it's important I pace my growth rather than rush rush rush into decisions for the short term. Owning a small organization and maintaining in the USA, not an easy task. It is important to focus on improving my small organization base as much as possible. I am achieving the right things with the little power I have.


Thinking About My Childhood- October 21st, 2024

This morning, while getting ready for the gym, I remembered some crazy times as I made my clips. As a kid, I recalled the image of Kobe Bryant from elementary school, when the Lakers played against the Nets. There is an image of Kobe Bryant posing for a dunk, when he had an afro.My favorite image in basketball culture is that one. It has confidence, it has drive, and it’s an image that is hard to forget. It’s crazy to think how much influence a man I’ve never met has over my life. Lately, I've been focused on self-reflection, wondering who I am as a person and what I truly stand for. Every person is put on earth for a reason. Don't let people belittle you; instead, try to discover who you are as a person.


Amount of Effort- October 22nd, 2024

Take a look at what you do every single day. Every day, we use tools and stencils. Today, I brushed my teeth with a toothbrush from a certain company. Today, I used a pen to write an update on where my company, UNGUARDED, is headed. Today I lifted a weight that was made by someone else. Everything is created by a company/team, and nothing great is accomplished alone. Building a base with people is much more powerful than working alone. It’s disappointing to see how many small businesses unnecessarily compete with each other. Competition is needed in life, but collaboration with the right people is powerful. Amazon works with Google. Google works with Apple. Unity is more powerful. As I type this, I glance at myself and sadly realize that, due to the way the world is, there’s not much I can do to unite people.


What Can I Do to Help?- October 23rd, 2024

I have to see how I can help people on earth. That is what life is about. Helping each other grow. So when I look at myself, I am a Muslim. So religion becomes controversial because it scares people off. One of the most important things in my life is sports. Sports brings people together regardless of religion, race, culture, etc. Without basketball, I wouldn’t have met so many people in my life. Now, the chase in my life is corporate ownership. It used to be basketball for me, but now it’s ownership of UNGUARDED. Another way to bring people together. Of course, some people will be upset, but ultimately, a corporation's purpose is to bring joy and create more fun opportunities for people. As I continue to grow, I’ll get there.


Building Own Infrastructure- October 24th, 2024

I realized that building a base is extremely difficult. Building a strong foundation and ensuring safety is far more valuable than wealth. If done properly, great things happen and people get uplifted rather than thrown down. Seeing people struggle hurts, but I’ve realized that my spirit can uplift and motivate them to be greater. I pray for people to have easier lives, but I’m unsure how to make that happen. To deal with this, I focus on building unguarded and empowering individuals. These days, I’m limited in what I can say due to regulations, laws, and other factors, but I strive to stay grounded and inspire people by making public appearances.


Waking Up Early and Sleeping in Early- October 25th, 2024

Waking up early is a blessing. It shows discipline and it shows character. PBUH used to wake up early in the morning and go to bed early.First and foremost, I don't want to compare my life to PBUH, as he was a much better man and I'm far from perfect, but as each day progresses, I believe thinking like PBUH is the way to go in life. He did everything for a reason and everything is the way it is for a reason. Most of our life's problems stem from a lack of capital funds and finances. If we had situations that kept us away from finances and territory, there would be fewer fights. Being peaceful is always the way to go.


My Brain is Saying NO- October 26th, 2024

At this time, my brain is saying no. I don't want to program and I don't want to have to sit there for hours working on user authentication/2fa, store integration, and subscription integration. Someone else should be doing this for me, but in life, things don't work that way. Unless one can provide for someone else and make their life more stable, there is no reason for someone to give their life up for user authentication/2fa, store integration, and subscription integration. Sometimes though it's important to do things you don't want to do, so I'll have to get to learning this and maybe by 30-35, I know how to accomplish more for myself and UNGUARDED.


Seeing a Spider- October 27th, 2024

While lifting today, I saw a spider crawling down. I tried to kill the spider, but I missed with my attempt. Back in the day, there was a story of PBUH who got saved by a spider in a cave. Amazing to see these correlations in real life in 2024, especially during this tech aged century.


How Life Works- October 28th, 2024

Today, I walked Princeton, New Jersey. One of the first things I realized is how hard people have to work to provide for their families. Some work lower roles, some work higher roles, It is important to work. Whatever level you are in life, it's important to remember to work for a purpose. As I keep building this organization, I want to make sure there is a purpose. I want people to love what they do. One day, I'll have the capital to help people. When one gives me capital, they will need a return. If one needs a return, then sometimes the purpose is lost. The whole purpose of a company is to help people. I am still trying to find out the purpose of this company. Have to work your way to the top.


Missing Google Class- October 29th, 2024

Due to the high interest of UNGUARDED internationally, and due to my age and so much going on, I'll have to sit back and miss the course. I am a huge fan of Google. Google is a tool I obviously use every single day, but I am showcasing myself and still looking for VC investment. I really do like Google.


UNGUARDED- October 29th, 2024

UNGUARDED- Salman Hassan. Thankful.


Respecting Everyone- October 30th, 2024

So in life, it's really important to stand for something and see how you can help someone. Also something I learned from my past is have more respect for people and neighbors. Since I'm way older now, it's mighty important I think about the story of the old women. The old women always used to give a hard time to pbuh. So obviously I'm not pbuh and I have done wrong things before like any other human, not that wrong though. I try my best everyday, to do things that way. Pbuh left the women alone, and the women converted to Islam to the end. Always try to live that way in life. These days I'm too busy working on corporate alignment to help people stay away from war and bad things. I can't really go down and help these days, but I do care about the people who are getting hurt for no reason.


Not Having a Purpose- October 31st, 2024

In life, one must always have a purpose and hold it dear to their heart. Many in life are addicted to the flash, meaning they are addicted to the look/lifestyle. The only way to achieve that look is to have a sense of purpose. Those are the people who earn it, but never take it for granted as well and use it for good. So now I know that I have to leave my sense of purpose on this platform. The idea of my life is to use my life to inspire the world. The good, bad, and evil, and try to build out my theories as big as possible and chase my dream of building a conglomerate. Happy Halloween as well.


Giveaway- November 1st, 2024

Today was a giveaway for the kids. The kids were happy and excited that I gave them stickers. I also gave stickers to adults. Some of the kids wish they were in my position, but it doesn't matter as god willing they will get jobs as well.


My Life- November 2nd, 2024

I have to continue to build my life and showcase who I am every single day. Today, I went to lift and recorded myself. One day I hope my channel has other top-tier influencers who are lifting for me. I'll get there though. This is a blessing to own and god willing/iA I continue to grow. I'm thinking about other things I can develop as well outside of internet influence. How I can inspire more people from the community.


The Election- November 4th, 2024

So this election, I won't be voting because it's such a close call. Sadly, in the real world, it's been crazy and much controversy has been going on. I do love being here in the USA, but since I've grown up here my whole life, it's not as appealing. I might go overseas a bit and see what's going on there. I always have to work and always have to see how I can help people next to me. In life, though if you want to be great, can't wait for it, have to work for it.


Who is Going to Win- November 5th, 2024

No idea who is going to win today. It's going to be a close one for sure. I am excited for sure to see who our new president is going to be.


Presidential Winner- November 6th, 2024

Donald Trump has won. That is a crazy victory. I do think the country will be in safer hands and will be more strict. Obviously it plays a role in my life. I have to focus on VC investment and have to focus on building my own brand as much as possible to help the community and help the world.


Jumping on 60 Inches- November 7th, 2024

Today I went to the gym and landed a 60-inch jump. Mentally the way I felt was who cares but let's take the risk. Mentally the way lifting is is the way life is. In life, one can't be afraid of things, so one has to take risks and try to push as hard as possible. Have to pace things, but calculated risk is necessary in life. One can learn a lot from lifting. Lifting and life/business correlate. You get what you put in. One has to prepare to lift weights mentally and spiritually. As a business owner, one has to prepare the same way. One has to prepare a lifting plan. A business owner has to prepare a business plan. One has to execute a lifting plan. A business owner has to execute his/her business plan. Lifting weights can teach a lot in life and correlates to business.


Mobile App- November 8th, 2024

Yesterday, I tried to launch my own mobile app. At the moment, the app doesn't have the most features, but it is enough to be on the store. I'm excited to see my app on the mobile store.


Staying Strong Mentally- November 9th, 2024

So at this time, I've been waiting for things to follow through. I have no idea where my life is going to go, but it's going to go towards good things. The direction of my life is up to me to an extent. I'm proud of how much I've accomplished thus far and I look forward to accomplishing more.


Pakistan Wins- November 10th, 2024

So obviously I'm from the USA and support all cultures and religions, but it's awesome to see Pakistan win the Cricket ODI series against Australia. I am Muslim and my family is from Pakistan originally, so it's great to see the progression of Pakistan and they continue their success. I love seeing this from the USA from my small perspective. I hope to keep tabs more on cricket as immigration continues in the USA.


Veterans day- November 11th, 2024

Today is a sad day because I am a US citizen and it is Veterans Day. I hate to see wars happen for no reason that tarnishes relationships between people. War is never the answer. I'll be really honest I don't know enough about why wars start and wars happen but I do hope things become more liberal.


Helping Others- November 11th, 2024

I am grateful for everything I have, I can't wait until others are cared for. Maybe one day I get VC investment. No complaint either way because compared to a regular individual, I have a lot of blessings. The thing is I earned my blessings. I'm proud of myself that UNGUARDED.com is live on the internet thanks to me programming it myself using Meta Technologies. A huge accomplishment in my life and I do expect more for my life.


Delusion- November 12th, 2024

Life is all a delusion.


Creating Something/Building Something- November 13th, 2024

It's essential to build something that can help people and set an example. Take a step away from people, and think about things without money. How is this helping someone? How is this improving someone's life? This is what UNGUARDED stands for. We live in a world where things are the way they are, but there are ways to find balance and create something great, with more people happy and fewer people getting hurt. That's what UNGUARDED stands for.


Makes No Difference- November 14th, 2024

Life is all a delusion as I said before. It's important to have a purpose in life, otherwise people don't know where they are going. Since most of us have to pay our bills, our minds are wired for capital capital capital. Think of your dreams, think of things that can actually change the world, and let the capital come to you.


Thinking About Basketball Times- November 17th, 2024

I miss those times when I used to travel and film top-tier athletes. Those days were awesome. I do wish I programmed instead of playing basketball. Imagine I filmed all this content on YouTube at 15 years old and started programming instead of fooling around. Shame on me. From these experiences, I learned a lot about people in the sports environment and human nature. People are the way they are and I am the way I am. Now I'm focused on really staying sharp and staying peaceful but I have to make my dreams come true now.


Think Small- November 18th, 2024

Always think small. Think linear and think safe. The smaller and linear the better.


The Natural Turn of the World- November 19th, 2024

On 2/28/2025 is the start of Ramadan. The day I was born. If you look at the verse 2:28 V:40 in the Quran you would see why I do believe in Islam. "You were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, and then to Him you will ˹all˺ be returned". I did once have a near-death experience but then woke up, it showed signs of Allah/God existing. As far as UNGUARDED and this company, I'll be focusing on best talent rather than religion. These things do keep us spiritually going though in this world.


Checking In- November 27th, 2024

So it's been a while since I've checked in. I am alive and well focused more on development for my company UNGUARDED. There are a few issues here and there, but they are not as serious as all these issues will roll in. It is mighty important to make my organization big mainstream in my opinion. Grateful to run my company in the USA and this will be an everyone thing hopefully as it's about talent, not always about religion. UNGUARDED will hopefully be worldwide but I am already worldwide as I'm catered to every day. Thankful and put time and effort into incorporating for others to get employed.Sometimes I'm ungrateful but me putting in this work as we speak is why I'm grateful- Hassan.


I'm Way Too Rare Famous, This Feels Fake- November 27th, 2024

My whole life is documented, and I try my best to help others as fast as possible. I don't feel like I'm alive sometimes. Everything in my life has become all business. So now everything feels a bit fake, I have to aim up around and stay sharp and then see how I can help others I think. Also, keep in mind our world is still recovering from all sorts of things from the 1950s when it comes to power and all sorts of issues between each other. Mighty important I think mainstream is the way to go.


The Story of Muhammad PBUH [End of Times]-November 27th, 2024

Muhammad P.B.U.H said at end times, that robots, TV networks, and all sorts of things would take over our lives towards the end. Although I am liberal, these things do control our lives and I do adjust to mainstream people. I do think there are ways we can work together but it is crazy to see all these things happening in our face that were proclaimed by Muhammad P.B.U.H. So many exceptions all of us had to make have led to all sorts of things out of control in our world. I thought 2020 Covid-19 would solve it but no one adjusted and continued forward. When it comes to UNGUARDED, I shall continue forward and corporate. I do respect everyone but all of us have become slaves to our companies and what we do. Hopefully, PIF can invest in my company directly and we can find that balance with everyone. I did just forget I am famous and that balance has been achieved. Hopefully even better to hire in-house.


Thanksgiving [NJ/NY]- November 28th, 2024

Today is Thanksgiving. There is a lot to be thankful, but a lot to take care of on my end.


Having Motive/Sense of Direction- November 29th, 2024

Discipline is everything in life. It doesn't matter if money is involved or not, that's how great things are attained. I remember myself at 8-10 years old, setting my schedule and having my dreams. Regardless of whether those dreams worked out, I always tried my best to stay sharp. I would make mistakes but I am disciplined. At age 29, I maintain a different dream, but I always try my best to stay disciplined. There wasn't much fun in my life.


Avoid the Tough Work- November 30th, 2024

So basically in life no one wants to do the tough work, because it requires people to go through things that no one wants to go through. It's important to remain peaceful but this is something I do see catching up in our future.


Yankee Jacket- December 2nd, 2024

Growth is important in life, but the NYC in me will never leave.


Turns Out I'm Mighty Famous- December 3rd, 2024

Turns Out I'm Mighty Famous- December 3rd, 2024 It just hit me. I'm way too famous for my own good.


Takes Time- December 9th, 2024

So things take time. I am grateful and peaceful. My mindset though absolutely crazy and wild.


Thoughts as an Entrepreneur- December 23rd, 2024

Ok so marriage is going to be tough. About to be 30. Do you think I'll be able to pull it off by my special birthday? No one really in mind. 2/28/2025


So Thoughts- December 27th, 2024

I am really blessed and mighty grateful that so many document me. Nothing in life is about money it's about safety. I have more than half the assets here and do own this IP on bank. Not selfish but as far as this company things take time.


Keeping Positive and Smiley Vibes- February 25th, 2025

So tomorrow I must be sharper. Thomas and sweets was fun. It helped me keep the kid in me. It’s always about keeping the kid in you. My mind woke the hell up and I’m finally out of this crazy crap mind. Back to being the boy.


Time To Grow Up- March 4th, 2025

So from my perspective it doesn’t matter. When you invest in your own talent then from there you learn a lot. The most important thing in life is coding. Nothing else. Once you can program your own IP you can own the world because MIT license grants you ownership of your IP that is made as long one is doing the right things. These are things that are going to change rapidly as our world progresses as so many will pop up with their own companies. Since I own my own company with no friend now I have to put everyone in better situations and make sure that they are building their own companies and eventually can collaborate. I also create content myself and play sports. Hopefully one day the money does replace me but the more one thinks about it the more one wants to stay away from money unless a serious max out buy out. At this time I roll by myself and I’ll pick people up if I get a max directly which would be a miracle and at the moment I own my own little establishment.


Where My Mind Is Now- March 9th, 2025

So at this time there’s so much going on and I’m completely tired. But that is all in the mind. I must focus on my skillset and building my spirit as much as possible. Now the issue becomes when I continue to pursues my life more and more comes up and that’s when finances come into play to replace the growth trajectory needed. Now I also must sharpen out my schedule which is a whole another situation because things come up left and right and I am in the mood for the gym but what’s more important is my programming rather than lifting but at heart I feel people are more enticed by my lifting.


So Exhausted- March 10th, 2025

My brains a bit locked today, but I will get through this.
